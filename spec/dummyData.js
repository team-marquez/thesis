          "description": "A sealed well underneath former Manhattan Bistro in Soho was the site of the 1799 murder of Gulielma Elmore Sands, who was strangled and dumped in the well on Spring St.The accused murderer was Levi Weeks, a fellow boarder in a house on Greenwich Street, whom Sands had been secretly seeing. Weeks was masterfully defended in court by Alexander Hamilton and Aaron Burr. As a result, the jury delivered an acquittal after just five minutes of deliberation.Weeks, nevertheless, had to leave the city, as he was widely condsidered guilty.The well is not open to the public, but it is sometimes accessible upon special request provided its status as one of the Travel Channel’s “10 Most Haunted Places in America.”The Manhattan Bistro above the site is also now closed, but it is visible in the lower level of a clothing store called COS.Sign up for our newsletter and get the best of Atlas Obscura in your inbox.",

          "description": "The Titanic Memorial lighthouse has stood at the entrance to the South Street Seaport since 1976. Before it moved to its current home, the memorial was erected on top of the Seamen’s Church Institute in 1913 after the Unsinkable Molly Brown insisted that a monument to those lost in the Titanic be erected.Margaret Brown, better known as Molly, was as stubborn after coming back to dry land as she was during her alleged rescue of fellow passengers during the Titanic’s sinking. Always larger than life, Brown insisted that a 60-foot-high lighthouse be erected in Lower Manhattan. When it was first built, just a year after the Titanic sank, a time ball was installed above the lighthouse, and dropped at noon every day in remembrance of those who perished.After the ball ceased to keep time in 1967, the lighthouse was moved off the roof of the Seamen’s Church Institute and became a part of the South Street Seaport Museum at the corner of Fulton and Pearl. As conspicuous as Molly Brown would have wanted it, the monument greets visitors to the Seaport with a reminder of the tragedy of April 15, 1912.Four blocks east of Fulton Street Subway Station.

          "description": "While it’s not smallest piece of park property in New York, Septuagesimo Uno is still a charmingly diminutive plot of land, occupying a mere 0.04 acres between two townhouses on West 71st Street. The creation of the park may date to Mayor John Lindsay’s era, but its roots lie in the Commissioners Plan of 1811, which laid out the Manhattan grid system of roads with 12 avenues and 155 cross-streets. Parks were included in the plan at 53rd, 66th, 77th and 120th Streets. But, while the plan was effective at predicting and handling the explosive growth the city would experience over the next 150 years, it ultimately failed to provide enough parkland for recreation. To help alleviate demand, Mayor Lindsay started up the Vest Pocket Park campaign, which squeezed public space in wherever it could. The lot on 71st Street was condemned in 1969, landscaped by the city and eventually handed over to the stewardship of the NYC Parks Department in 1981. As for its name? It’s Latin for “seventy-one,” and was appended by parks commissioner Henry J. Stern in 2000 after a $14,325 renovation. Its original name was the much blander “71st Street Plot.”Septuagesimo Uno is located on the south side of 71st street between West End and Amsterdam Avenues; the closest subway is the 1/2/3 a block away on Broadway. The park closes at dusk.Sign up for our newsletter and get the best of Atlas Obscura in your inbox.",

          "description": "This unexpected gem on Manhattan’s Upper West Side is a flashback to the past. Step inside, and you’ll uncover a collection of rare artifacts and barbershop equipment.The NYC Barber Museum is a new spot (it opened in June of 2018) dedicated to an old trade. It’s like a time capsule of an traditional early 20th-century barber shop.The museum is the work of Arthur Rubinoff, a fourth-generation barber and the founder of the Reamir & Co barbershop chain. His collection fills the space and includes nostalgic treasures like antique barber chairs and mirrors, gold and diamond-studded scissors, old razors, and of course, the classic striped poles that once hung outside so many barber shops. All the artifacts celebrate the art of the craft and the many people who have worked in the industry.While visiting, you can do more than admire the various antique items on display. The museum is actually a working barbershop, so you can get your hair cut or your beard trimmed in a beautifully decorated space that feels like it was plucked straight out of 20th-century New York. Patrons can choose from styles that reflect the 19th, 20th, and 21st centuries.Visiting is free, even if you don't get your hair cut. To schedule an appointment with the barber, call (212) 920-9716.The hours on Saturdays through Mondays are casual. On Tuesdays, it's open from 10:30 to 9:00. On Wednesdays, from 10:00 to 8:00. Thursdays it's open from 11:00 to 11:00, and Fridays it's open from 10:00 to 7:00.Sign up for our newsletter and get the best of Atlas Obscura in your inbox.",

          "description": "The mission of the Museum of Reclaimed Urban Space (MoRUS) is to preserve history and promote scholarship of grassroots urban space activism by researching and archiving efforts to create community spaces. They also exhibit materials that document these actions, to educate people on the political implications of reclaimed space. In the 1950s and ’60s, as wealthy residents started moving to the suburbs, property values plummeted across the city. Places like the Lower East Side were hit especially hard. The landlords, not seeing value in maintaining the properties or paying taxes, would collect rent until the city repossessed the property. As a result, New York City ended up owning tens of thousands of properties.Because the city was in an economic crisis and couldn’t maintain the buildings, it started cutting off services (like not maintaining infrastructure and shutting down schools and fire houses) to certain neighborhoods in an effort called “planned shrinkage.” As a result, buildings were left to burn and whole neighborhoods were left abandoned and decaying.In the late ’60s, struggling artists, punks, anarchists, transients, and activists saw an opportunity to reclaim these spaces. With a lot of hard work, they transformed the rotting tenements into livable spaces, the abandoned schools into community centers, and plots that were ruble into community gardens.When the late ’80s came along and the economy was on an up, people started moving back into the city. The price of real estate started to rise again, and the Lower East Side started looking like a desirable place to develop. Unfortunately, this led to many of the squatters being evicted and saw a lot of their community spaces shuttered.The squatters and activists fought hard and though most were evicted, about a dozen squats became legal co-ops and many of the gardens are still an essential part of the neighborhood today. If you look past the boutique shops, trendy bars, and fancy eateries you’ll see there’s a rich history of activism and resilience in the area. MoRUS is there to tell the story and to foster environmental and social change within the community.Museum entry free; suggested donation $5\nTours $20Sign up for our newsletter and get the best of Atlas Obscura in your inbox.",

          "description": "At the dawn of the 20th century it didn’t take as much effort to garner the attention of the buying public as it does today, but the core principle remains the same: novelty. The titular owner of William Barthman Jeweler had a clear grasp of this concept when he and an associate installed a working clock into the sidewalk outside their store.Barthman, along with one of his employees, Frank Homm, created the timepiece in 1896, but not as it exists today. The original clock was a mechanical jump hour clock with the numbered tablets that would flip over on the hour. It also had a little light bulb that would illuminate the clock at night. In the beginning, as passersby trampled across the clock face it was met with surprise and delight by turn-of-the-century shoppers. Unfortunately the fatal flaw of the original contraption was that it was custom designed by Barthman and Homm, and they were the only ones who knew how to fix it. Thus when the clock began to malfunction in later years, the attraction became an embarrassment, and the operators of Barthman’s store would cover it with cardboard each day to hide their shame.Unable to make the clock work with Homm’s special touch (Homm passed away in 1917), the only solution they could come up with was to replace the clock entirely. The new clock was a more traditional analog dial, ringed with a classy brass compass rose. With the installation of the new clock, and the lucky popularity of a photographer’s snapshot of the clock, the sidewalk novelty that had vexed them for years had once again become a popular feature for Barthman’s. The sidewalk clock still sits outside of Barthman’s on the corner of Broadway and Maiden Lane in lower Manhattan, just as it has for a century. It is estimated that over 50,000 people walk over the timepiece each day, not once stopping to ask the time.  Sign up for our newsletter and get the best of Atlas Obscura in your inbox.",

          "description": "Between Cop Cot and The Pond in the southeastern corner of New York’s Central Park is a four-acre area that, until recently, had been closed to the public since 1934.Originally called The Promontory by park designers Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux, it was left mostly wild as the areas around it were molded and sculpted into their urban pastoral vision. The Promontory was closed off in 1934 by Robert Moses (then Parks Commissioner, among other things), who designated it as a bird sanctuary meant to be undisturbed, unmaintained, and untouched. It was subsequently renamed The Hallett Nature Sanctuary in 1986, after nature lover and Citizens Union executive George Harvey Hallett Jr.In 2001, as part of the Central Park Conservancy’s Woodland’s Initiative, work began to restore the Sanctuary to something visitors could enjoy once more. Invasive plant species, like wisteria and Japanese knotgrass, were switched out for native ones, like Dutchman’s breeches and shooting stars, and what had been overgrown was very carefully tamed. Over the years, access has occasionally been granted to school groups, but starting in 2016, the Sanctuary began scheduling regular visitors’ hours for the first time.There may be a line to get through the beautiful new wooden gate, but it is worth the wait. Once in, there are guides posted around who will answer questions (to answer one that apparently gets asked a lot, the water at the top of the waterfall that issues into The Pond from the Hallett Sanctuary is piped up there). There is a woodchip path that visitors are asked to stay on as they explore the Sanctuary, and the path is lined with beautiful flowers, including azaleas, columbines, and adorable little Jack-in-the-Pulpits, as well as bushes and trees, all accompanied by identification placards. Looking past the groomed area along the path, the woods still bear hallmarks of their decades of wilderness, with massive roots of old fallen trees peppering the landscape.The Sanctuary sits on a giant boulder of Manhattan schist; at the highest point, there is an overlook providing views of the buildings of Central Park East, as well as The Pond itself and the large rock formations on the other side, sprinkled with climbers. This area also has benches where one can sit and listen to the birds. The benches were donated by Sima Ghadamian, a rare gems dealer, who was moved to create such a quiet, reflective space after the death of a friend. A “sanctuary within the sanctuary,” The New York Times calls it. If that sounds peaceful, it accurately represents the experience of wandering through the Hallett Nature Sanctuary.Enter Central Park at the intersection of 59th Street and 6th Avenue and head north, away from the pond.

          "description": "New York City’s skyline features a myriad of water towers, but one in particular stands out from the rest. MoMA’s rooftop sculpture garden features the familiar steel frame, but the container appears to be missing. In its place, you’ll find what looks like water in the shape of a coned cylinder resting atop the structure.The 12-foot-tall resin cast of the inside of a water tower is English artist Rachel Whiteread’s first public sculpture to be conceived and displayed in the U.S. After she was commissioned by the Public Art Fund in the ‘90s, she searched the city for what she felt would be a quintessential New York City symbol.Whiteread is known for her castings of everyday objects like bathtubs, hot water bottles, and even an entire Victorian house. “Water Tower” was made using a once-functioning cedar tower. She chose it for the wood’s distinct texture, which she then imprinted on the casting. The translucent sculpture changes color and brightness with the weather and is all but invisible at night.The piece was installed on a rooftop on West Broadway and Grand Street in SoHo in 1998, but it has since been moved to MoMA. Like Whiteread’s other works, it almost appears to be a fossil. If you’re ever at MoMA, keep an eye out for the glowing artifact of city life.The Water Tower is best viewed from West 54th Street between 5th and 6th Ave.Sign up for our newsletter and get the best of Atlas Obscura in your inbox.",

          "description": "In the 1970s tenement vacancies in the Lower East side left some buildings up for grabs, as squatters in need of downtown housing soon discovered. In 1989, squatters discovered the building that would become C-squat.It gutted by fire and without stairs or landings, but this didn’t stop them from transforming the space.The squat became famous because its residents repaired it after it fell into dangerous decay. Famous punk shows were held in the two-story basement (which resulted from a cave-in). A half pipe was also installed. In 2002, C-squat joined a network of nearby squats to negotiate the sale of the buildings from the city. The plan went like this: Each building would be sold for $1 USD to a nonprofit intermediary. The nonprofit would then take out loans on the squatters’ behalf to renovate the buildings and bring them up to code. Once the renovations were finished and the building was up to code, it would be transferred to its residents, along with the accumulated renovation debt.In 2012, the Museum of Reclaimed Urban Space (MoRUS) moved into the ground floor space to earn rent and keep their monthly co-op payments affordable. In 2015, the squat officially became a low-income co-op.Accessible from L Train at 1st AvenueSign up for our newsletter and get the best of Atlas Obscura in your inbox.",

          "description": " Constructed just five years after John Lennon’s tragic death, Strawberry Fields quickly became a well-known pop-culture pilgrimage site, and is now presided over and decorated by one dedicated super-fan.Situated across the street from the Dakota, the building in which John Lennon lived and was killed, Strawberry Fields is a 2.5 acre chunk of Central Park focused around a mosaic with a single, powerful word in its center; imagine. During his career with the Beatles, Lennon inspired many, and since 1985 people have flocked to pay homage to the fallen music hero.One man took it upon himself to act as the keeper of Lennon’s legacy at the memorial. Gary dos Santos was well-known around New York City and was a fixture at Strawberry fields. The self-proclaimed mayor of Strawberry Fields began hanging out near the memorial in the mid-1990s and never left after John Lennon told him in a dream to keep maintaining the memorial.dos Santos made a living off of tips from tourists who paid him what they could after a deliverance of a short monologue on Central Park, John Lennon and peace. Besides his work as tour guide, dos Santos also contributed his own sort of artwork to the memorial, and regularly laid out flowers in the form of a peace sign over the mosaic in dedication of John Lennon.While dos Santos passed away in November 2013 from complications from leukemia, he will always be remembered as an integral figure to Strawberry Fields and an important fixture to Central Park itself through his dedication and beautiful adornments to the memorial.Sign up for our newsletter and get the best of Atlas Obscura in your inbox.",

          "description": "Although Governors Island off the coast of Manhattan has seen an off-and-on military presence since the Revolutionary War, one need not enlist to reach it any longer. In 1996 the Coast Guard – the last of the military tenants of the Island – finally folded up their charts, and while it took a few years and some (luckily) unfulfilled development plans, Governors Island is now open to the public from May to September, finally allowing access to historic Castle Williams.On the northwest corner of the island, Castle Williams was the jewel in the defensive crown set up on Governors Island to protect New York from attack during the War of 1812. The circular red sandstone defense was finished in 1811, a cousin to the better-known Castle Clinton at Battery Park just across the channel. The eight-foot-thick walls of the “castle” were arranged in a circular arch so that the 100 cannons installed within could fire in just about every direction.The defense was fearsome enough that it never even had to be tested. The British never attacked New York during the War of 1812. The fort remained and acted as a Union barracks and jail during the Civil War, before being converted to a full military prison later on. The castle operated as a prison of some sort until 1965, when the aging structure was finally decommissioned.Today Castle Williams is restored and protected as a historical landmark on Governors Island. During the summer months, the castle can be toured with the help of a guide who will walk visitors through the many lives of the historic fort.The ferry leaves 7 days a week from lower Manhattan (terminal next to the Staten Island Ferry), at South & Whitehall Streets. On weekends there is also a ferry from Pier 6 at Brooklyn Bridge Park, at the end of Atlantic Avenue.Sign up for our newsletter and get the best of Atlas Obscura in your inbox.",

          "description": "The block of Broome Street between Allen and Eldridge is the smelliest block in New York City. The New York Times Magazine tested the area with a number of olfactory experts, who all agreed it is the worst smell known to the City.If you happen to think you can handle anything, or that you’ve smelled worse, hop a subway down to the Lower East Side and take a few whiffs. Better yet, challenge a friend and make the loser buy lunch at Shopsin’s, only a few blocks away.A local magazine conducted an investigation on the smell recently, and figured out that the smell was coming from  stacked boxes of raw poultry that have been marinating in the sun. While you would think that the place would be slapped with a fine or a warning from the health inspectors, but the smell is technically legal, so the legendary scent of Broome street lives on, unopposed.Accessible from B,D Trains at Grand Street StationSign up for our newsletter and get the best of Atlas Obscura in your inbox.",

          "description": "Sitting just across from the Hudson River on Manhattan’s West Street is what appears to be a titanic concrete Aggro Crag, but it is in fact an abstract representation of a salt grain. Which makes sense, because that’s what it does. Store salt.The ultra modern Spring Street Salt Shed is an effort by the city to make even their most utilitarian edifices into unique pieces of art. Finally unveiled in 2015, the strangely angular structure stands in sharp contrast to the staid buildings surrounding it. Joining some 40 odd other sheds in the city that also hold road salt for use in the winter months, the new salt shed is certainly the most fashionable. Even the concrete that the six-foot-thick walls are made of has a special, blueish luster thanks to bits of slag that were added to the mix during construction.When in full use, the bunker-like shed will hold around 4,000 tons of salt, piled 40 feet high, and that’s about it. For all of the high design efforts added to the exterior of the building, inside it is pretty much just a big box, fitted with a giant door for trucks to drive through.The salt shed cannot be entered, but anyone traveling along the Hudson River in Manhattan can see it from the street. Licking the surface is not recommended.   Sign up for our newsletter and get the best of Atlas Obscura in your inbox.",

          "description": "Located in a neighborhood that has changed all around it, Keen’s Steakhouse still displays the thousands of clay pipes that were once held for presidents, writers, and other world-famous celebrities.When people think of Manhattan’s theatre district, Broadway and Times Square immediately spring to mind. But the city’s original theatre district was in the Tenderloin area which is now known as Herald Square. And since 1885, actors, audience members, and theatre impresarios would seek refreshment at Albert Keen’s chophouse. Legend has it that actors in full costume from the Garrick theatre next door would rush into Keen’s between acts for a quick ale and a bite of his famous mutton chops before running back on stage.But what makes Keen’s quite so extraordinary is what hangs from the ceiling: the world’s largest collection of Church Warden pipes. Being made of clay and too fragile to carry around, smoking enthusiasts would keep their pipes at the tavern for their own private use when dropping in. And Keen’s has over 90,000 pipe smokers on its roster, amongst them such tobacco smoking luminaries as Theodore Roosevelt, Buffalo Bill Cody, Herbert Hoover, Albert Einstein, and Babe Ruth. Each pipe is numbered, and upon entering the Chophouse, you would hand your membership over to a page boy who would retrieve your pipe. City laws today have brought an end to this civilized past time, but the 90,000 pipes still adorn the ceilings of the dining rooms of Keen’s Chophouse. As you walk through the rabbit warren of rooms (the Lincoln Room, the Lambs Room, the Lillie Langtry Room) and end up at the wood paneled bar, over which hangs the seductive portrait of Miss Keen, the proprietor’s mistress, it is easy to imagine stepping back in time, to when this corner of New York was the heart of its theatrical community.Today’s visitors can enjoy themselves in this hidden New York gem with Keen’s own pub ale and their famous mutton chops. “A mutton chop at Keens!” ran an old advert, “There’s a reminder to thrill a man who has been around! This pleasant old tavern is the perfect spot for a chop and a mug of ale!” As true today as it was over 120 years ago. Sign up for our newsletter and get the best of Atlas Obscura in your inbox.",

It’s a dreamy sight, where planets and zodiac symbols entice visitors into a world where science and poetry blend seamlessly. Impressive as it is, the work of art is eclipsed by the store’s true star: its vast collection of French books.Albertine is physical proof of the French government’s dedication to fostering intellectual exchange between French and American people. It’s a haven for both francophones and bibliophiles alike. The bookstore, which is sponsored by the Cultural Services of the French Embassy, was started in 2014 in the historic Payne Whitney Mansion. It contains over 14,000 books from 30 French-speaking countries and is the only store in New York City dedicated entirely to books printed in French and English.It’s a beautiful space, a quiet respite from the bustling city. In addition to its stellar ceiling, the bookstore is adorned with busts of famous figures from French and French-American culture, such as Descartes and Benjamin Franklin, and a floor-to-ceiling mirrored Venetian room. A replica of Michelangelo’s Young Archer sculpture stands in the building’s entrance. Its predecessor, which is believed to be an original Michelangelo work, was loaned to the Metropolitan Museum of Art after decades of being ignored.Visitors can pop into the store and peruse its expansive stock of literary titles. Albertine also hosts debates, discussions, and readings that are open to the public.Subway: 4/5/6 at 86th Sreet or the 6 at 77th Street.

          "description": "“Everything had a lounging, listless, madhouse air, which was very painful. The moping idiot, cowering down with long disheveled hair; the gibbering maniac, with his hideous laugh and pointed finger; the vacant eye, the fierce wild face, the gloomy picking of the hands and lips, and munching of the nails: there they were all, without disguise, in naked ugliness and horror.” -Charles Dickens, 1842Built in 1834, the new insane asylum on Blackwell’s Island, today known as Roosevelt Island, was designed to be a new model for mental health, located on the island countryside outside of the bustle of the big city. But almost from the beginning the asylum became known for its underfunding and overcrowding, for the staff’s neglect and the inmates’ desperately abysmal living conditions. Patients dropped dead from outbreaks of typhus and cholera, and even the easily preventable scourge of scurvy took its toll on the malnourished inmates. Long after Dickens’ visit conditions continued to decline.In September of 1887, a young reporter for the New York World concocted an elaborate ruse to get herself committed to the asylum in order to report on the conditions from within. “Ten Days in a Mad House” went on to be Nellie Bly’s breakthrough piece of journalism, not only proving her mettle as a truly extraordinary young journalist but also bringing much-needed attention to the dismal conditions within the city’s metal health system.In part, she wrote, “What, excepting torture, would produce insanity quicker than this treatment? Here is a class of women sent to be cured. I would like the expert physicians who are condemning me for my action, which has proven their ability, to take a perfectly sane and healthy woman, shut her up and make her sit from 6 a.m. until 8 p.m. on straight-back benches, do not allow her to talk or move during these hours, give her no reading and let her know nothing of the world or its doings, give her bad food and harsh treatment, and see how long it will take to make her insane. Two months would make her a mental and physical wreck.”At least in part as a result of her exposé, the institute was given nearly a million dollars in additional funding to improve the facilities and care on Blackwell’s.The architecture, on the other hand, was gorgeous. Dickens, despite his above comments, was actually charmed by the building itself, calling it “spacious and elegant.” The building was designed by noted New York architect Alexander Jackson Davis, and its distinctive blue-grey stone was quarried on the island. The building’s beautiful spiral stairway and domed cap were added in 1878.After the asylum’s tenants were relocated at the end of the century to nearby Ward’s Island, the building was renamed Metropolitan Hospital and remained in use as a general-purpose health care center until the 1950s. Since then, various plans for the historic building were proposed but never enacted, and it slowly began to crumble. By the early 2000s, after nearly a century of neglect, the building was a ruin: an empty shell, a victim of neglect and fire, with a collapsed ceiling and nearing the point of no return.In 2006, the property was purchased and the building converted into a residential complex. The trademark octagon tower is the only part of the original building remaining, preserved on the exterior, but completely re-designed inside including a new, modern metal spiral staircase.Although a plaque at the entrance attempts to detail the site’s history, the web site for the current residential building makes no mention of the asylum, or of Nellie Bly’s famous stay, and only notes that Dickens found the physical building to be “remarkable,” conveniently leaving out the bits about gibbering maniacs and naked ugliness.Sign up for our newsletter and get the best of Atlas Obscura in your inbox.",

          "description": "On the Lexington Avenue side of Manhattan’s famous Waldorf Astoria hotel is the exclusive private Marco Polo club lounge. Next to it is the site of the salon where Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis had her famous bob cut. During renovations to the hotel in the 1990s, something extraordinary was found hidden in the walls between the club and the salon.No one knows exactly who put it there or why, but buried away was a secret treasure trove: the forgotten archives of the historic luxury hotel, which has been host to royalty, the Hollywood elite, and every U.S. President since Herbert Hoover since its opening in the 1890s.The archive is comprised of vintage postcards, menus, cocktail lists, ledgers, photographs, and bellhop uniforms, giving remarkable insight into this most glittering of institutions. For anyone interested in the forgotten glamor of old New York, it’s an incredible find. Today, the physical archive lives in a bespoke office in the hotel. Piece by piece, the archive is also making its way online. One of the highlights is the collection of old menus and drinks lists; impeccably illustrated in the Art Deco style, they give a flavor of what the well-heeled patrons of the Jazz Age were enjoying in between dances in the hotel ballrooms. Whether you would like to look up photographs of Herbert Hoover dining in the Empire Room, or what a cocktail menu from the Bull and Bear bar looked like in 1960, the collection is there to be explored.Sign up for our newsletter and get the best of Atlas Obscura in your inbox.",

With a background in finance and a unique collection of financial memorabilia acquired by his wife’s auction house, Herzog began organizing a museum of finance, to better educate the public about the free market and Wall Street.The first major exhibit in 1989 focused on Alexander Hamilton, the first Treasury Secretary. Since then, the museum has expanded and undergone major renovations. When it reopened in January 2008, the museum could not have predicted how much the market would change in the coming year. And the public needed the education it could provide.Located at 48 Wall Street, the museum is in the oldest bank in the United States, founded in 1784. Only a block from the New York Stock Exchange, The museum celebrates “the spirit of entrepreneurship and the democratic free market tradition which has made New York City the financial capital of the world.”Through permanent exhibitions on the history of money, banking in America, and the financial markets, the museum hopes to educate the public about the world of commerce in which they engage every day.When the credit crisis hit, the museum began chronicling the changes and now features a timeline dating back to February 2007 about the causes and impacts of the Recession. It seems Wall Street traders could use a trip to the museum, too.Sign up for our newsletter and get the best of Atlas Obscura in your inbox.",

          "description": "If one were to go to the very beginning of this building’s history you would actually start with what is now the clock tower.A tall octagonal wooden fire lookout tower once stood on this site and was located in the center of Jefferson Market in 1833. Court sessions were held in the rooms built above the market which would soon be torn down to make room for a new courthouse and an adjacent jail building.Originally built as the Third Judicial District Courthouse and designed by architect Frederick Clarke Withers, the Jefferson Market building would serve this purpose from 1877 to 1945. The courthouse saw a lot of action in its day, serving what was then known as “The Tenderloin” entertainment district.After its decommission the building’s future was in jeopardy. Luckily, a community preservationist, Margot Gayle, and writers like E. E. Cummings and Lewis Mumford rose to the challenge and formed the Committee to Get the Clock on Jefferson Market Courthouse Started which eventually got the New York Public Library to convert the disused courthouse into a library.The library opened in 1967, entered the National Register of Historic Places in 1972, and was declared a National Landmark in 1977.Sign up for our newsletter and get the best of Atlas Obscura in your inbox.",

          "description": "The legend of the West Side Cow Tunnels has long been a part of urban myth, repeated by someone who heard, but never from someone who knew. The story goes that sometime in the 1870s, the need to alleviate cattle traffic in the streets resulted in the creation of an underground ″Cow Tunnel″ beneath 12th Avenue and 34th Street.From there the stories fluctuate wildly. Everything from where the tunnels are — some people put the location of the tunnels on Joralemon Street — to what exactly the tunnels were made of —  with oak, steel, and fieldstone all being candidates.One of the only published accounts of the tunnels comes from an old article from the Tribeca Tribune in June of 1997, which follows the wild goose chase of a Con Edison employee as he tracked the vague leads of his friends who knew a friend who saw the tunnels. In the end, the myth of the West Side Cow Tunnels seemed to be just another urban fancy.That is, until 2004, when hints of the legendary Cow Tunnels resurfaced. An archeological report from the NYC Landmarks Preservation Commission and the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation, and Historic Preservation mentioned underground ″Cattle Tunnels″ at 34th Street and 38th Street. The tunnels are believed to have been built for the West Side slaughterhouses. According to the New York Times, a report from 1847 cites cattle being herded to their deaths underground along 34th and 35th Streets, as well as 12th Avenue. Unfortunately, if the tunnels are still there, they may be lost under the Javits Center. Sign up for our newsletter and get the best of Atlas Obscura in your inbox.",

          "description": "Since the mid-1800s the New York Academy of Medicine has been ensuring that the city’s doctors have a unified voice and resource base, and since landing in their longtime headquarters in the 1920s the organization has curated one of most extensive libraries of historic medicinal texts anywhere in the world, all available to view by the general public.The academy’s semi-secret library holds over 500,000 books, pamphlets, and other pieces of aging ephemera. Beginning with a donation to the academy in 1847, the collection has grown over the years thanks almost entirely to donations and some prizes purchased specifically for the library. Most of the items in the sprawling catalogue date from between the 15th and 18th centuries, including almost every single piece of medical writing printed in North America during the 1700s. Among the rich leather volumes and brittle pamphlets are rare works by Sigmund Freud, historic works on disease and obstetrics, and famously, a pair of prototype dentures made of real teeth that were the model for George Washington’s replacement chompers.Thanks to the preservation and conservation efforts of the academy staff, the aging books and papers are kept in terrific condition, even in spite of the inexorable frailties that time constantly imposes on the works. In fact, one of the major efforts of the library today is to get as many of the items digitized as they can before they are lost to time and deterioration.       Anyone interested in the odd history of bodily discovery and treatment, or just stunning collections of old tomes, need only make an appointment to see one of the most impressive hidden libraries in the city. If one would like to check out some books it is advised to send an email (library@nyam.org ) to the library staff a few days in advance. In the email it will be best to mention the time you would like to arrive to the library . Sign up for our newsletter and get the best of Atlas Obscura in your inbox.",

          "description": "Dwarfed by the massive ruin of the Renwick Smallpox Hospital at the southern end of Roosevelt Island, this small Romanesque stone building was once the home to groundbreaking work in understanding disease in the early 20th century.Funded by the Strecker family, for whom the lab is named, the small building was constructed in 1892 as a support laboratory to the larger City Hospital nearby on the island. City Hospital was originally constructed to serve the medical needs of the large prison population on the island as well as New York City’s poorest citizens. At the time, Roosevelt Island was almost entirely dedicated to confinement of one sort or another, with a smallpox hospital at the southern tip and an insane asylum at the northern.In 1907 the building was taken over by the Russell Sage Institute of Pathology. By the 1950s, it was abandoned.Despite having fallen into ruins (along with many of the historic structures on Roosevelt Island), the laboratory was designated a historic landmark in 1972 but it took until 2010 for a full restoration to put the building back into the near pristine condition you see it in today. The historic structure now hides a power conversion substation for the trains running to the island.You can find the building just north of the smallpox hospital on the path that runs along the east shore of the island.Sign up for our newsletter and get the best of Atlas Obscura in your inbox.",

          "description": "While today it is a creepy urban catacomb covered in graffiti and dirt, the abandoned 18th Street subway stop in Manhattan was actually in use up until 1948.It was originally opened in 1904, and at the time all of the local subway stations on this route could only accommodate five car trains. As service expanded, larger capacity stations were required, so the NYC Board of Transportation began extending the length of many stations. The nearby 23rd Street station was extended southward to accommodate ten car trains, adding an exit at 22nd Street. Of course, having two stations within four blocks of each other didn’t make much sense, so the 18th Street station was closed.While this station was closed and “abandoned,” it was never forgotten. Hundreds of trains pass by this station on the 4/5/6 lines, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. It’s visible from passing trains and covered in graffiti. For street artists, the station walls provide a relatively safe place to paint in an otherwise extremely busy, potentially deadly subway tunnel without many other safe places for a human and trains to co-exist. Those who have dared to enter the tunnel to paint this station now have an audience of over a million daily commuters viewing their work.If you want to see it for yourself, just take the 6 train at anytime and find a window facing the wall.In the subway tunnel, between 14th street and 23rd street stops.

          "description": "Of all the items The New York Historical Society has in its collection, one particular portrait of a person in a blue dress is perhaps its most controversial and mysterious. Though officially listed as “Portrait of an Unidentified Woman,” some claim it depicts Edward Hyde, 3rd Earl of Clarendon.As the royal-appointed governor of the colonies of New York and New Jersey, it was expected that Hyde would pose for a portrait. What was unexpected was that he would chose to do so in a beautiful blue dress.Being a cousin of Queen Anne, Hyde bore a slight resemblance to her highness. Whenever he could, Hyde would accentuate his likeness to her by donning dresses of the finest fabrics and putting his hair in the latest women’s styles. Politicians, civil servants, and visiting dignitaries were often shocked to be greeted by the governor in his choice of apparel. Hyde even took to wearing gowns and jewelry when he opened assembly sessions.When questioned on why he would choose such an unorthodox style of dress, Hyde maintained that it was nothing but appropriate. He reportedly told critics, “You are very stupid not to see the propriety of it. In this place and particularly on this occasion I represent a woman (Queen Anne) and ought in all respects to represent her as faithfully as I can.”Hyde also had a habit of playing pranks on people. He would often hide behind trees and jump out to scare the unsuspecting passerby. And while cross-dressing and childish pranks are harmless, the rampant corruption during his administration was not. Hyde readily accepted bribes, embezzled defense funds, interfered in local governments, and persecuted followers of the Presbyterian Church.It is for these reasons Edward Hyde is remembered as one of the most infamous governors of New York and New Jersey history. But whether this portrait truly does depict him remains a mystery.The portrait is located in the New York Historical Society. The society can be reached by subway by taking the C train to the 81st Street-Museum of Natural History station. The museum is located adjacent to the American Museum of Natural History.The building is closed on Mondays. Its hours are 10 to 6 on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Saturday. It’s open 10 to 8 on Friday and 11 to 5 on Sunday.Sign up for our newsletter and get the best of Atlas Obscura in your inbox.",

          "description": "In Southeast Asia, the durian is known as the “king of fruits.” It is also banned in most public places because of the smell, which has been described as rotten onions, garlic, turpentine, raw sewage, farts, dead birds, rotten apple juice, and French-kissing your dead grandmother.That putrid odor has been known to cause people to wait across the street while their friends eagerly consume the spiky tropical fruit. The taste has a much better reputation, favorably compared to caramel or egg cream with a strong hint of almonds by way of a custardy/scrambled eggs texture. Durian is also highly nutritious, not unlike a coconut. But unlike coconut, the Asian fruit is relatively rare in the U.S., and the best place to get it in New York  City is Durian NYC, an unassuming stall in Chinatown on the corner of Grand Street and Bowery.Durian NYC has been open for nearly 20 years, and much of its success can be attributed to its former salesman Jay Fan (“the durian man”), who became famous for his expertise in distinguishing between and preparing different kinds of durian. He carefully cut and packaged the fruit to preserve the aroma (which some people actually like) and he would warn about inferior durian being sold at neighboring fruit stands.Fan also had quite a few anecdotes about his experience selling durian, like the one about the time someone called the police when Fan refused to give a refund after the person had gotten a whiff of the open fruit. The police arrived and, curious, as so many who approach the durian stand are, ended up buying some for themselves (Fan gave them a discount). One returned the next day to get some for the captain.Fan has moved on from the stand, but videos of him cutting the durian are still available online. Durian NYC is still going strong, just like the durian itself is still dividing people. They can be expensive, but those who are determined usually find that the experience is worth the cost, and the smell. Sign up for our newsletter and get the best of Atlas Obscura in your inbox.",

          "description": "At the entrance of Delmonico’s on Beaver Street in Lower Manhattan, two marble columns seem out of place against the terracotta and brick structure. Reputedly, this pair of pillars was taken from Pompeii.The exact facts are fuzzy, but story has long held that the columns were salvaged from the ruins of the Roman city destroyed by Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD and incorporated into a previous Delmonico’s restaurant that was subsequently ruined in the Great Fire of 1835.The restaurant chain — started by two Swiss brothers in 1831 as a pastry shop — had expanded into ever more lavish dining establishments. Delmonico’s was the first in the city to offer printed menus and tablecloths, as well as private tables and solo dining for women. The building on Beaver Street in 1891 continued their stately profile. Designed by James Brown Lord, the Renaissance Revival building carefully took over a wedge-shape of land.Whether or not the columns are really from Pompeii, they are symbolic of the history of New York. By claiming the columns as survivors of that ancient disaster, and pulling them out of the ashes of New York’s own devastating fire, Delmonico’s offered an icon of endurance. Sign up for our newsletter and get the best of Atlas Obscura in your inbox.",

Mirrored panels lining the walls reflect 18th-century European furnishings and beautiful artwork. Delicate porcelain flowers sprout within intricately entwined metal latticework. A floral timepiece crowns the milky white fireplace.The embassy’s Venetian Room is a rare surviving piece of New York’s Gilded Age. The lavish display, which was created in 1906, was finished by famous architect Stanford White less than a year before he was murdered. White spent years traveling to Europe to hunt for inspiration and decor to turn his vision into a reality.The room was commissioned in 1902 by a businessman named Oliver Payne, as a wedding gift for his nephew. It was constructed in the former Payne Whitney Mansion, which now houses the Cultural Services of the French Embassy. The luxurious room was dismantled in 1948 and remained tucked away in storage until 1997, when it was donated to the French-American Foundation and reinstalled in its original place.The gorgeous Gilded Age room was recently restored and spent months hidden from view as it was buffed, scrubbed, and returned to its original grandeur. It reopened to the public in June of 2018. Now, anyone can stop to catch a glimpse of the century-old reception room while passing through the embassy’s lobby on their way to Albertine, its celestial-ceilinged bookstore.Sign up for our newsletter and get the best of Atlas Obscura in your inbox.",

          "description": "The strong German Jewish community of the Lower East Side in 19th century New York wanted a synagogue that reflected the stunning architecture happening with the German Reform movement in Berlin, so they enlisted Berlin architect Alexander Saeltzer to build a place of worship that would rival the Cologne Cathedral.Constructed in 1849, the synagogue had seating for 1,500, over 50-foot-high ceilings, and a main space with 7,000 square feet. It was the largest synagogue in the country at the time. However, after World War II the Jewish population in the neighborhood dropped off, and the synagogue closed in the 20th century. It is likely the gorgeous building would have been demolished if not for Jewish Spanish sculptor Angel Orensanz who converted it into a studio and gallery space in 1986. It’s now the oldest surviving synagogue in New York City, and the Angel Orensanz Foundation regularly hosts art exhibitions and events, including concerts from the likes of Philip Glass and Lou Reed, and even hosted the first fashion show in the United States from Alexander McQueen. It maintains its original architecture, although made into an almost ethereal place through its colorful lights and suspended illumination in the main hall. Visits are by appointment only, so be sure to call first.Sign up for our newsletter and get the best of Atlas Obscura in your inbox.",

          "description": "Stroll through the galleries of the American Academy of Arts and Letters in Washington Heights and you’ll suddenly find yourself transported back over half a century to the studio of American composer Charles Ives.While he didn’t get much recognition in his lifetime, Ives’ meditative, early experimental compositions are now recognized as greatly influential on the direction of modern music. Here at the Academy housed in historic Audubon Terrace, some 3,000 artifacts from the studio he used for 40 years were carefully relocated and reassembled. Look closely at the small space, illuminated by a light box that replicates the view in Redding, Connecticut, and you’ll find the late composer’s James & Holmstrom piano with a cane on the back of the chair set up before a hidden liquor stash, pencil sharpener still with the shavings, and a hat tossed on a shelf. Sheet music for “The Unanswered Question” rests on a music stand. Although Ives passed away in 1954, the studio feels as if he’s just stepped away. The Charles Ive studio is open for viewing by appointment and during exhibitions at the Academy. Sign up for our newsletter and get the best of Atlas Obscura in your inbox.",

          "description": "Despite its close proximity to both Manhattan and Queens, getting to and from Roosevelt Island has always been something of a challenge.Before the trolley that once ran across the Queensboro Bridge starting in 1909, the only access was by boat. When that trolley stopped running in 1957, the little community was once again all but cut off from Manhattan, with only a newly-opened bridge connecting it to Queens. In the 1970s, the island began being developed for residential use (for years, it was known as “Welfare Island” for its hospitals and asylums), and the addition of a subway stop was planned. But as the population of the island continued to grow, construction of the subway station became mired in delays and it was decided that something needed to be done, and quickly.Enter the aerial tramway: flying in from Manhattan at 250 feet above the East River, the tram began operation in 1976. Although it was really intended as a “temporary” solution until the subway connection could be completed, it still connects Manhattan to Roosevelt Island today, even after the subway station finally opened in 1989. For a decade, it was the only commuter service aerial tramway in the country (a second was built in Portland, Oregon, in 2006).The aging system was overhauled in 2010, and now runs new cars on a regular daily schedule.Sign up for our newsletter and get the best of Atlas Obscura in your inbox.",

          "description": "The Earth Room is a 22-inch-deep layer of dirt spread across a 3,600-square-foot gallery space in the middle of Soho.Created by American artist Walter De Maria in 1977, it has been a peaceful, quiet sanctuary from the bustle of the street below for three decades, where the mix of smells from the streets of New York are reduced to only one: the rich smell of soil. While there were originally two additional Earth Rooms, both in Germany, this is the last one remaining.To keep the Earth Room in good shape, curators must regularly water the dirt. Occasional mushrooms have been found sprouting in the 280,000 pounds of dirt. Though it would be a difficult piece to transport and reinstall elsewhere, it is estimated to be worth at least a million dollars. The space itself, in Manhattan’s trendy SoHo neighborhood, is probably worth much more.Press the buzzer for the Earth Room at the front door.Sign up for our newsletter and get the best of Atlas Obscura in your inbox.",

          "description": "Now dwarfed by the surrounding Wall Street skyscrapers, Trinity Church was the tallest building in New York City when it was completed in 1846. The surrounding stones are even older than the church, many dating back to the 17th century. The Trinity Churchyard in Lower Manhattan is part of the Episcopal Parish of Trinity Church, which has three burial grounds in the city including nearby St. Paul’s and Trinity Cemetery in Washington Heights. While the most notable interment of Trinity Churchyard is definitely Alexander Hamilton, the whole burial ground has a wealth of 17th- and 18th-century funerary symbolism, with plenty of flying skulls and hourglasses. For example, there’s the two-sided tombstone of Richard Churcher, a five-year-old boy who died in 1681. His tombstone is the oldest carved gravestone in the city, and on the back has a dimensional hourglass and skull and bones. James Leeson also has a very unusual stone. The 18th-century gentleman requested that along with classical Masonic markings and funeral iconography his tombstone be marked with an insoluble message. The bizarre-looking words are written in a “pigpen” cypher, sometimes used by Masons to code their text and keep their knowledge out of the hands of the curious. The symbols actually mean “Remember Death,” a classic message for the 18th century which becomes, through the form of an enigma, a version of the well-known “Memento Mori.” The grave is on the Broadway side of the cemetery, facing the fence.Sign up for our newsletter and get the best of Atlas Obscura in your inbox.",

The quarter-acre of Ireland on the edge of Manhattan is a memorial to the over one million Irish who died during the Great Famine of the 1840s, as well as those who continue to suffer from hunger.Designed by artist Brian Tolle, the Irish Hunger Memorial in Battery Park incorporates a Famine-era stone cottage brought over from County Mayo, Ireland, and reconstructed as the heart of the monument. Visitors can enter directly from the street up a path through the suspended field, or through a tunnel lined with granite and words behind glass remembering worldwide hunger crises, while a ghostly recording plays voices recounting famine.Room has been left for more words to mark new hunger crises. From the top of the field at 25 feet in the air, there is a view of the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island, the first stop for many of the over two million Irish immigrants to the United States.No explanatory text can be found at the Irish Hunger Memorial. Instead, visitors are left to create their own narrative, deciphering meaning in the unexpectedly tranquil and solemn space.Sign up for our newsletter and get the best of Atlas Obscura in your inbox.",

          "description": "Dwarfed by neighboring skyscrapers, the Midtown sports bar Overlook is easy to well, overlook. Although it caters to thirsty sports fans, Overlook has something amazing to offer those who grew up reading comics rather than playing ball. In the back of the bar is a wonderfully done mural created by some of the greatest artists in comics.The mural, in fact, predates Overlook. The building where the bar is currently located was home to a hot spot known as Costello’s. When renowned cartoonist James Thurber couldn’t come up with the funds to pay off his rather sizable bar tab, he drew cartoons on the walls in exchange for clearing the debt.By 1974, New York Daily News sports cartoonist Bill Gallo recruited some of his comic colleagues to fill up the rest of the walls after a marathon night filled with free booze and food.The result is an awe-inducing collaboration of notable artists such as Mad contributors Sergio Aragones and Al Jaffee, “Family Circle” creator Bill Keane and Milton Caniff of “Terry and the Pirates” fame, among many others. Pop culture icons Popeye, the Phantom, Bullwinkle, Beetle Baily, Archie, Little Orphan Annie, Betty Boop, Fred Flintstone, Felix the Cat, and Spiderman adorn the mural. The cartoon mural is a hidden historical marker of the comic industry in New York.The Overlook bar is located in midtown Manhattan and is easily accessible by public transport.Sign up for our newsletter and get the best of Atlas Obscura in your inbox.",

However the true experience of the museum is on the street outside.When the weather gets warm, travel to East Harlem on a Sunday morning and you’ll find you’ve entered a stadium. 109th St. between 2nd Ave. and 3rd Ave. transforms into a playing field for those both new to the game and those who’ve been playing for decades in the form of organized stickball leagues operating through the Hall of Fame. Front-row seats are free if you can find a stoop to sit on. If your window or fire escape happens to look down on the street you’ll find you’re a season ticket holder to seats in the “upper deck.” No game could be more local. Neighbors are not only fans, but the game’s commentators as well. But a word of warning about cheering for a home run; if the ball is hit onto a roof in stickball it’s an out. If the ball breaks a window or gets you in trouble you’re not only out but you also just ended the game.For those completely new to the classic street game, the rules are similar to the basic gameplay of baseball, with a few minor differences. While this could change from neighborhood to neighborhood, generally players are only given one swing when they are up to bat. Anything from fire hydrants to manhole covers to streetlights can stand in as bases and a variety of these bases/street fixtures can be found at the museum. Stickball has generally been considered a “poor man’s” game because all you need to play is a group of friends, a rubber ball (called a “spaldeen”), a broomstick, and a street to play on. But don’t let the humble origins of the game fool you, stickball’s history is one of a pastime used to keep youth out of trouble and bring neighborhoods together.Sign up for our newsletter and get the best of Atlas Obscura in your inbox.",

In fact, the reactor was never fueled and was never radioactive.Issues with permits stopped the use of the reactor in 1972. The reactor was removed from Pupin.

          "description": "If you were to look at a Google Map of Lower Manhattan, you will see something quite unusual marked at Pearl and Broad Streets: the mysteriously named “Portal Down to Old New York.”For near here, set into the pavement under glass at the pedestrian plaza that curves around 85 Broad Street, are the visible remnants of colonial-era New York, discovered in an archaeological dig undertaken in New York. Every day, thousands of workers in the Financial District pass by without noticing what lies underfoot, preserved under glass.  The 1975 excavation uncovered some of the only physical relics of the old Dutch colony left in Manhattan, dating back to when the city only stretched a few blocks further north. The preserved site, across from the venerable Fraunces Tavern, shows some of the oldest buildings to be seen in the city, including part of the colonial City Hall. The Stadt Huys dates from 1642, from when New York was Dutch-owned and called New Amsterdam.A few steps away are the remnants of the old Lovelace Tavern, dating from 1670. The Lovelace Tavern had been owned by the then-governor of the fledgling colony, Colonel Francis Lovelace. Its foundations were discovered during construction of 85 Broad Street. Aside from the historic building fragments, the dig also yielded old Dutch tobacco pipes, more than 11,000 pieces of glass, and 23,000 fragments of pottery. Sign up for our newsletter and get the best of Atlas Obscura in your inbox.",

          "description": "Prior to September 11, the General Slocum steamship fire was the greatest loss of life in any disaster in New York City history. However, its memorial in Tompkins Square is easily overlooked.The nine-foot stele sculpted by Bruno Louis Zimm from pink Tennessee marble shows two children in relief with the words “They were Earth’s purest children, young and fair.” A lion’s head spits out water into a small basin. On June 15, 1904, some 300 of the 1,300 passengers to board the General Slocum excursion steamer were children under the age of 10.Almost all of the passengers were from Kleindeutschland, or Little Germany, an area in today’s East Village. The Slocum had been chartered by the St. Mark’s Evangelical Lutheran Church on Sixth Street and Second Avenue for their annual picnic. As it was a weekday, most of the passengers were women and children. Just 20 minutes after the boat left the Third Street pier, a fire broke out.Pandemonium ensued. The life vests turned out to be worse than useless, sinking with whomever jumped in (most of the passengers were unable to swim), and lifeboats were painted to the side of the ship. The captain sped the boat towards North Brother Island in an attempt to beach it, but the speed just fanned the flames. By the time the boat arrived to the quarantine hospital island, it was consumed in fire. Patients and doctors attempted to save people by tossing them debris. By the end of the day, around 1,000 people were dead.Many of the deceased were interred in Middle Village’s Lutheran cemetery, where a monument was built in 1905. The Tompkins Square fountain was dedicated in 1906. As for Little Germany, with mostly men left behind with their families dead, they dissipated throughout the city, and you can only find small traces of this past in the rare German sign on an old building in the East Village. Sign up for our newsletter and get the best of Atlas Obscura in your inbox.",

          "description": "There’s a hospital on the Upper West Side that stands out from the dozens of others within New York City. Its patients stay in cages rather than beds. And when they’ve been freed, many will take to the sky rather than the streets.The Wild Bird Fund—the only wildlife rehabilitation center in New York City—sees over 3,000 feathered and furry patients each year. Its staff treats and, when possible, re-releases each injured, sick, or orphaned critter that passes through.Though humans dominate the concrete jungle, it’s still home to an abundance of wild animals. The city’s resident creatures, along with those who travel through on their seasonal migrations, too often find themselves in need of a helping human hand. Ailing animals lucky enough to cross paths with a kind stranger will likely wind up at the Wild Bird Fund.The rehabilitation center hosts a menagerie of nonhuman city dwellers. Its demographic includes a wide variety of birds, ranging from pigeons to house sparrows to falcons to even the occasional owl. The center also treats non-avian animals like squirrels, opossums, and wild rabbits.The Wild Bird Fund sees each animal free of charge. Its staff, which is largely comprised of volunteers, performs a range of procedures including radiographs, surgery, physical therapy, and feedings to help each patient heal. The staff also works to educate the public about how to coexist with the city’s nonhuman residents.Guests are welcome to visit the reception center to learn more about the Wild Bird Fund. However, as it's a working animal hospital, behind the scene access isn't allowed.Sign up for our newsletter and get the best of Atlas Obscura in your inbox.",

          "description": "The sculptures known as Gay Liberation are profound in their simplicity. The monument shows two same-sex couples enjoying a day in a park. Although it may not seem like a very dramatic scene, it’s this act of normality that makes the monument so revolutionary.Gay Liberation is one part of the Stonewall National Monument commemorating the rebellion that led to the modern gay rights movement. It was commissioned by the Mildred Andrews Fund in 1979 to commemorate the 10th anniversary of the Stonewall riots.The American pop artist George Segal sculpted bronze statues and then covered them with white lacquer, which was a trademark of his work. He chose to depict the couples in relaxed poses to convey affection and intimacy as opposed to the hyper-sexualization then common in media depictions of gay people. For members of the LGBT community, such a show of openness and comfort was denied to them for so long.The artwork faced controversy from the very beginning. The sculpture was intended to be on public land in New York City, but gay rights opponents blocked its installation. It was the city of Madison, Wisconsin, that first welcomed the sculptures. It wasn’t until 1992 that Gay Liberation finally went back home to New York, where it currently resides in Christopher Park in the West Village.You can take public transit to the West 4th Street-Washington Square station.

          "description": "Collyer Brothers Park is a small pocket park in Harlem, providing a temporary reprieve from the surrounding urban sprawl. But visitors taking a break on one of the park’s benches may be surprised to know that the park only exists because of the bizarre behavior of two brothers that would eventually result in their grisly death.Homer Lusk Collyer was born in New York City in 1881, with his brother Langley born three years later. Their father, Herman, was a successful Manhattan gynecologist and their mother, Susie, was a former opera singer. Both brothers attended Columbia University and Homer eventually became a lawyer and Langley a concert-level pianist.Although the brothers had shown signs of eccentricity in their youth, their problems began to intensify in 1919 when, for unknown reasons, their father abandoned the family. When their mother died six years later, the brothers took all their possessions and moved them into the brownstone mansion for which they would achieve their infamy. Around that time, the neighborhood was becoming popular with African Americans and two wealthy white brothers in their forties began to look out of place in the minority neighborhood. Perhaps because of this, there were several attempts to break in and local children often threw rocks at the windows. The brothers became paranoid and boarded up their windows, with Langley rigging up the house with various booby traps. From then on, they became recluses, although Langley was occasionally seen outside, scavenging through garbage cans for food to bring back for his brother, who was slowly being ravaged by rheumatism and blindness.Apart from a few isolated incidents, they were rarely seen or heard until March 21, 1947, when the police were tipped off about a possible dead body in the house. They broke down the door and were confronted with piles of junk so large that it took them two hours to find Homer’s corpse dressed in an old bathrobe with his filthy gray hair reaching down to his shoulders. On March 30, false rumors circulated that Langley had boarded a bus for Atlantic City, but on April 8, nearly three weeks after the alarm was first raised, his decomposing body was found just ten feet from where his brother had perished. He had been crawling through a tunnel of newspapers when he had activated one of his own booby traps, which crushed him. His paralyzed brother starved to death several days later.In total, 130 tons of junk was removed from the house, including baby carriages, rusted bicycles, a collection of guns, glass chandeliers, bowling balls, camera equipment, three dressmaking dummies, painted portraits, plaster busts, rusty bed springs, 25,000 books, eight live cats, hundreds of yards of unused silks and fabric, clocks, 14 pianos, and a selection of pickled human organs in jars. The brothers were buried in Brooklyn and the same year, the house was torn down. By the 1960s, it was being used as a park, leaving future generations to dwell on the brothers’ strange and tragic lives.On the corner of Fifth Ave. and 128th St. The nearest subway is 125th St. (Martin Luther King Junior Blvd.).Sign up for our newsletter and get the best of Atlas Obscura in your inbox.",

          "description": "The Waldorf-Astoria is rightly regarded as one of the world’s great luxury hotels. A byword for New York glamour and opulence since it opened its gleaming art-deco doors in 1931, it has been home to such glittering names as Marilyn Monroe and Grace Kelly. It is the only hotel in America to have been the residence of three 5-star generals (Eisenhower, Bradley, and MacArthur), and every US president since Herbert Hoover has stayed there. No wonder owner Conrad Hilton called it “the Greatest of Them All.”Hidden away around the corner on the Mezzanine floor of the Park Avenue entrance, out of sight to all the well-heeled passersby, sits an elderly and well used grand piano. It has a small brass plaque on it, which says “Some of the loveliest songs in American musical history were composed on this Steinway.” It once belonged to one of the hotel’s most famous residents, but now forgotten and unused, here lies the final resting place of Cole Porter’s piano. The original Waldorf-Astoria started in the 1890s as two adjacent hotels run by feuding relatives of the Astor family; William Waldorf Astor and John Jacob Astor. Occupying the corner of Fifth Avenue on what is now the site of the Empire State Building, the quarreling cousins eventually put aside their differences, and built a corridor connecting their hotels. Giving rise to the hyphenated Waldorf-Astoria, the hyphen represented the illustrious “Peacock Alley,” the gilded corridor which was the place for the cities wealthiest and prettiest women to see and be seen. The need to modernize saw the hotel move to its Park Avenue location in 1931, and was at the time, the world’s largest and grandest hotel. Three years later Cole Porter moved into his luxurious rooms on the 33rd floor. With six bedrooms, a marble entryway, and panoramic views of Park Avenue, Porter kept his apartment until his death in 1964. Already one of America’s pre-eminent songwriters and composers, Porter kept a 1907 Steinway grand piano in his apartment. Decorated with suitably elegant flowers, gilt edges, and inlaid carvings of partying Regency-era courtesans, it was on this piano that Cole Porter wrote some of his most loved and famous songs including Anything Goes, I Get a Kick Out of You, You’re the Top, and I’ve Got You Under My Skin.An in-famous bon vivant, giver of lavish parties and writer of elegantly witty songs filled with sexual innuendo, one wonders at what exquisite cocktail evenings took place up on the 33rd floor around the piano which he named “High Society.” After Porter’s death in 1964, the piano remained in the hotel, and for 14 years it was lovingly played in the hotel lobby by Daryl Sherman, herself an elegant throwback to Manhattan’s once elegant nightlife. But a change of ownership in 2007 saw Sherman shown the door and the piano put aside. Today Cole Porter’s apartment, 33A, currently rents for $150,000 a month and was, until eclipsed by the Astor suite at the Plaza Hotel, New York’s most expensive apartment. But the piano where he wrote, “You’re the top....you’re a Waldorf salad,” has been shuffled off to the side of the Mezzanine, where it sits unplayed and unnoticed. A forgotten relic of New York sophistication and a golden era, described in the words of its elegant owner, “In olden days a glimpse of stocking was looked on as something shocking, but now, God knows, Anything Goes.” Including shuffling off an important American artifact.  Sign up for our newsletter and get the best of Atlas Obscura in your inbox.",

          "description": "Columbus Park in downtown Manhattan is a peaceful place. Bounded by the government buildings of New York’s Civic Center on one side, and by the outskirts of Chinatown on the other, it is home to pick-up basketball games and games of cards played long into the night under arc lamps by the elderly residents of Chinatown. Designed by the venerable Calvert Vaux of Central Park fame, it is one of the city’s oldest and quietest public parks. But for most of the 19th century, it was one of the deadliest places on Earth. It was known by a different name then. This was the epicenter of the infamous Five Points neighborhood, which had the highest murder rate in the world. Five Points was part of the Sixth Ward of Manhattan, the so-called “Bloody Sixth.” It was a disease-ridden, volatile slum, where inhabitants lived in appalling squalor, ravaged by epidemics of cholera, yellow fever, and typhus. The worst of the tenements, where those unfortunates who called them home lived in overcrowded rooms and cellars shared by up to 20 people at a time, were found along a particular stretch of Mulberry Street called the Mulberry Bend. So named because of the way the street angled sharply to avoid the festering Collect Pond, the Mulberry Bend was described by police beat reporter Jacob Riis as “the foul core of New York’s slum.” Consisting of a maze of squalid shacks and back alleyways blackened by grime, each with such evocative names as Bandit’s Roost, Bottle Alley, and Ragpickers Row, the <i>New York Daily Tribune</i> wrote in 1850 of “the underground holes and corners…the narrow, dark, filthy cellar, where drunkenness, vice and misery fester in their fullest manifestation.”The slums were deadly enough, but the violent gangs that patrolled the Five Points, even more so. These vicious bands of murderers, extortionists, and thieves like the Chichesters, the Forty Thieves, and the Dead Rabbits made the Mulberry Bend lethal. Fighting pitched battles with their arch enemies the Bowery Boys, they were eventually clamped down on by the New York City Police Department after the Civil War, only to resurface as the even deadlier Whyos. An insight into the daily lives of the Whyos comes from gang member Piker Ryan, arrested in 1884. He was found carrying a list of services offered by the gang, starting with “punching” ($1) and carrying through to “both eyes blacked” ($3), “nose and jaw broke” ($7), “(black)jacked out” ($15), “ear chewed off” ($15), “leg or arm broke” ($19), “shot in the leg” ($20), “stab” ($21.50), and ending with “Doing the Big Job” (AKA murder for $100 and up). By the end of the 19th century, due in large part to the campaigning efforts of journalist Riis, public outcry called for the slums of the Five Points to be cleared. The gambling dens, saloons, and slaughterhouses were razed and replaced with Calvert Vaux’s park. Almost all of the rows of tenement buildings were demolished, all except one, the most infamous of all. Visitors today walking up the southern part of Mulberry Street, with no fear of attack from roving Whyos or Dead Rabbits, will notice about halfway along Columbus Park that the street angles sharply away. Here is a row of old brick houses, all that remains of what was once the old Five Points, the still standing Mulberry Bend. The Mulberry Bend can be reached by walking up Mulberry Street from Worth Street or walking down Mulberry Street from Bayard Street.Sign up for our newsletter and get the best of Atlas Obscura in your inbox.",

          "description": "The City Hall Library has existed for over 100 years, and over that tenure has cobbled together a collection of close to 66,000 books and a staggering 285,000 magazines, newspapers and assorted pieces of ephemera dating back to the 19th century.The library is tucked just inside the historic Surrogate’s Courthouse in Lower Manhattan and visitors can find it with little more than a Google search, yet many locals and tourists are oblivious to this historic gem due to its lack of external signage, a result of the building’s untouchable landmark status.Seekers who do locate the library can browse the stacks of massive, worn and weathered tomes on scintillating subjects such as the laws and charters of New York, or biographical files on the city’s many mayoral personalities. While the various annual reports and bound logs cannot be checked out, there is a quiet (and mostly empty) reading room where interested parties can pore over their findings.Beneath the ground-floor rooms open to the public are the private municipal vaults containing hundreds of storage boxes filled with material chronicling the city’s history all the way back to the unification of the five boroughs.In addition to clipped periodicals and delicate newsprint, the archives contain countless photos, letters and thousands of maps and blueprints from throughout New York’s long, architectural history. The maze of stacked boxes and rolled-up schematics is not open to the public but can be researched and viewed with the help of the location’s above-ground library staff.The City Hall Library and its attendant archives are adjoined by a recently created visitors’ center which showcases many of the collection’s incredible finds including the original deed to Coney Island and Jazz-Age mug shots of famous mobsters.  Update October 2017: The visitors’ center is closed, but the library is still open in room 111. Sign up for our newsletter and get the best of Atlas Obscura in your inbox.",

          "description": "In the 1970s tenement vacancies in the Lower East side left some buildings up for grabs, as squatters in need of downtown housing soon discovered. In 1989, squatters discovered the building that would become C-squat.It gutted by fire and without stairs or landings, but this didn’t stop them from transforming the space.The squat became famous because its residents repaired it after it fell into dangerous decay. Famous punk shows were held in the two-story basement (which resulted from a cave-in). A half pipe was also installed. In 2002, C-squat joined a network of nearby squats to negotiate the sale of the buildings from the city. The plan went like this: Each building would be sold for $1 USD to a nonprofit intermediary. The nonprofit would then take out loans on the squatters’ behalf to renovate the buildings and bring them up to code. Once the renovations were finished and the building was up to code, it would be transferred to its residents, along with the accumulated renovation debt.In 2012, the Museum of Reclaimed Urban Space (MoRUS) moved into the ground floor space to earn rent and keep their monthly co-op payments affordable. In 2015, the squat officially became a low-income co-op.Accessible from L Train at 1st AvenueSign up for our newsletter and get the best of Atlas Obscura in your inbox.",

The sculpture weighs 18 3/4 tons and would measure 3,280 feet if all the elements were laid end-to-end. Each rod is placed such that the spaces between the rods increase by 5mm with each consecutive space, from front to back; the first two rods of each row are placed 80mm apart, the last two rods are placed 580 mm apart. Metal halide stadium lights illuminate the work which is 45 feet wide and 125 feet long.This work is the companion piece to De Maria’s 1977 Vertical Earth Kilometer at Kassel, Germany. In that permanently installed earth sculpture, a brass rod of the same diameter, total weight and total length has been inserted 1,000 meters into the ground.The Broken Kilometer has been on long-term view to the public since 1979.

          "description": "Matchmaking is an old-fashioned trade, one that traditionally catered to older men looking for young brides. It happened in back offices, behind closed doors. The Modern Love Club subverts all that, bringing a colorful and openminded attitude to the matchmaking process. In this narrow East Village shop, nothing is for sale—but you might meet the love of your life.It started around a decade ago, when Amy Van Doran noticed that even her most attractive, competent, interesting friends had difficulty finding dates. She began her matchmaking service as a performance art piece, but one without irony or cynicism. She would set up a booth that read “MATCHMAKER” (a la Peanuts’ Lucy van Pelt) in the park and invite strangers to chat with her. The stunt turned out to be successful—her clients preferred being set up to swiping, as it made for a more organic, honest date. Fast forward to today, when Amy’s Modern Love Club has serviced around 7,000 clients. Those looking for love can submit themselves via the MLC website, or just waltz right into the brightly colored storefront to chat with the matchmaker. There’s no science to matching, but Amy says she envisions her clients as characters, complete with likes, dislikes, a childhood, and a romantic history, and imagines them with the other characters in her rolodex. The club’s physical space also acts as the “Love Museum,” with love-centric art adorning the colorful walls. It’s a spot to hang out and meet new people too: a “free date” bench in front allows strangers to park themselves and converse. The Club wears a lot of different hats. Many passersby are unsure what to make of a East Village storefront that doesn’t sell anything. But no matter what people ask for, Amy’s guiding mission is to be useful. “If someone walked in and asked me to fix their shoe I would do it,” she said. When an art exhibition called “Sugar Lovers” led kids to believe the store was a candy shop, Amy began stocking sweets.Amy expects the men to be as well-groomed and personable as their female counterparts, and also caters to the LGBTQ community. The clientele is no secret either–the club regularly hosts raucous single-mingle parties. As soon as you’ve crossed the threshold into the Modern Love Club you are in a non-judgmental, open space where everyone is curious about everyone else. In the end, that is really the purpose of the Modern Love Club. It doesn’t promise lifelong happiness or even a successful relationship, but it can certainly guarantee an enjoyable experience and human connection.The space is accessible by appointment only. The Modern Love Club hosts parties and events that focus on love from time to time. Sign up for our newsletter and get the best of Atlas Obscura in your inbox.",

          "description": "No visit to New York’s Union Square is complete without pondering, and then subsequently becoming frustrated with the Metronome, a digital display of 15 numbers changing at various speeds, designed by Kristin Jones and Andrew Ginzel in 1999. It is clear that the clock, embedded in the facade of a building on the southeast corner of the square, has the time for its left-most digits–hours, minutes, seconds…but what does the rest of it mean?Crossing the middle digit, the numbers begin to slow down again, leading to the right-most number, which scarcely moves. It turns out that reading from the right, the numbers denote the time remaining until midnight, hours, minutes, seconds, etc., moving faster towards the center. In other words: the time displayed (backwards) on the right of the clock + the time displayed on the left of the clock = 24 hours.In this sense, the Metronome is something of a modern-day hourglass, with time flowing from its left side to its right, and moving fastest in the middle, like grains of sand in an hourglass. The Metronome also provides one bookend to Park Avenue South, the other being the more traditional clock at Grand Central Station. The two mirror each other, displaying exactly the same information in two very different ways.Sign up for our newsletter and get the best of Atlas Obscura in your inbox.",

Few would ever think this small artifact was once escorted by armed guards and took center stage at many well-attended viewings, showings, and exhibitions.Created around 500 AD and discovered in 1910 in Syria, the artifact is thought to have belonged to a church in the ancient Turkish city of Antioch, which was an important city for early Christianity. After it was discovered, its inner cup was originally believed to have been none other than the fabled Holy Chalice, the cup Jesus used during the Last Supper.The elaborate outer shell was thought to have been formed around the brittle, fragile inner cup to honor Christ. However, it’s now believed the cup wasn’t a chalice at all and was instead a standing oil lamp.Even if it isn’t the lost grail, the artifact is still an exquisite item. It’s decorated with a variety of motifs including images of Christ, lotus flowers, and leaves. There are also many different animals on the chalice, plus figures thought alternatively to be Jesus’s apostles or philosophers all wrapped within a grapevine. The chalice is in gallery 300.Sign up for our newsletter and get the best of Atlas Obscura in your inbox.",

          "description": "Behind impressive heavy doors and ornate turn-of-the-century stained glass windows lies the Explorers Club headquarters on East 70th Street.Founded in 1904 by seven leading polar explorers of the era, the Explorers Club fosters the scientific exploration of land, sea, air and space. The 1910 Jacobean revival mansion was originally built for Stephen Clark, grandson of the co-founder of the Singer Sewing Machine Company. The Explorers Club purchased the building from the Clark family in 1960 after Stephen’s death. It became the international headquarters in 1965. Prior to this, they had several locations in New York City.It is known as the Lowell Thomas building, named after the famed writer, broadcaster and Explorers Club member best known for making Lawrence of Arabia famous.A century’s worth of exploration treasures fill the floors. The ground floor member lounge houses a few of their polar artifacts. On your way up to the second floor, you won’t be able to miss the giant globe used by Thor Heyerdahl to plan his famous Kon-Tiki expedition.Percy, the polar bear, greets you on the second floor. As you head into the library, you will see The Rescue of Greeley, painted within hours of their rescue in 1884. The library holds a tiny fraction of the 13,000 books that make up the research and archives collection. All lectures and events are held in the Clark room. The walls proudly display a few of the retired expedition flags from historic explorations. A sled from the 1909 North Pole expedition and an extremely rare set of double elephant tusks from the Congo can also be found here.The uppermost floor is home to the research archives, holding the club’s impressive collection of 13,000 books, 1,000 museum objects, 5,000 maps and 500 films.The Gallery on the top floor is the room everyone wants to see. In the early days of the Explorers Club when travel was difficult and field photography was relatively new, hunting and taxidermy were thought to be the best way to preserve animals for education and research. Here you will see taxidermied animals from many decades past. Objects from the far corners of the world, including a narwhal tusk, wooly mammoth tusk (ask about the famous 1951 Explorers Club dinner) and the famous yeti scalp.Scaffolding was recently removed, revealing the results of a five-year long refurbishment of the building’s facade, but work continues to preserve the building. Visitors are welcome during opening hours. Group tours can be scheduled by contacting reservations. Regular talks with exploration greats are held in the Clark Room from September - June. Sign up for our newsletter and get the best of Atlas Obscura in your inbox.",

          "description": "Amid the over-stuffed wholesale shops and hole-in-the-wall newsstands of Manhattan’s Garment District, it’s easy to miss El Sabroso Restaurant on the first pass since it looks pretty much like every other freight entrance in the city.Located behind steel grey industrial doors in the drab loading entrance of a nondescript skyscraper, it’s overshadowed by the neon bolts of spandex and bejeweled evening dresses for sale at the wholesalers nearby. But the lines that form outside this hidden lunch counter are threatening to give away one of the neighborhood’s best kept secrets. El Sabroso is known for cheap and tasty Latin-American food, and most dishes, like pernil and pollo guisado, cost just $6 a plate.Tony Molina, the owner and operator of the tiny little luncheonette, purchased it from its previous owner who had run the counter for an unknown period prior to his reign. Since seating is limited, most customers take their meals to go. Between 7th and 8th Avenue.Sign up for our newsletter and get the best of Atlas Obscura in your inbox.",

On any given day, you may see a few of the island’s felines lazing around their little fenced-in sanctuary, well fed and utterly content.The Roosevelt Island Cat Sanctuary is easy to find just north of the smallpox hospital on the path that runs along the east shore of the island.Sign up for our newsletter and get the best of Atlas Obscura in your inbox.",

          "description": "In October 2001, recovery workers sifting through the rubble of the World Trade Center uncovered the remains of a Callery pear tree. Twisted and broken, its roots snapped and branches burnt, the workers nonetheless decided to pull the tree from ground zero, beginning its remarkable recovery.The chances of the tree recovering were slim indeed when it was placed into the care of the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation, who then sent it to the Arthur Ross Nursery in Van Cortlandt Park in the Bronx for specialist care. It was replanted in the Bronx on November 11, 2001, but was not expected to survive.For several years, the tree underwent a careful process of healing and rehabilitation. Then, in 2010, the Callery pear tree was returned to ground zero where it was replanted as part of the National September 11 Memorial. It was christened the Survivor Tree, a symbol of endurance, resilience, and hope.Since its return to ground zero, the tree has flourished. It is often the first plant to bloom in the Memorial plaza each year, its blossoms signaling the arrival of spring with an annual display of growth and rebirth. At the same time, the Survivor Tree bears the scars of its troubled past: Its smooth new branches reach upwards from its gnarled stump, a stark reminder of the tree’s dark history and its hopeful present.On September 11, 2013, the Survivor Tree seedling program was launched. Since then, the 9/11 Memorial has given seedlings from the Survivor Tree to three communities each year. These communities had all experienced recent tragedies, and the seedlings were given as a sign of solidarity and hope. Tree scientists have so far propagated some 450 descendants of the original tree, and recipients of the saplings have included Boston, San Bernardino, Orlando, and Paris, France.The 9/11 Memorial is open daily from 7:30 a.m. to 9 p.m.Sign up for our newsletter and get the best of Atlas Obscura in your inbox.",

          "description": "Hidden on the side of an old brick building on 10th Avenue and 29th Street is a curious and mostly overlooked little plaque. Dwarfed by the vast building sites that are currently dominating Manhattan’s West Side around the new Hudson Yard project, the plaque commemorates those who died and were mangled here. For this was once known as Death Avenue.Quite incredibly, a full-size railway line once ran down the middle of 10th and 11th Avenues. With no barriers, fences or platforms, these steam-powered juggernauts plowed down the West Side of Manhattan amidst the bustling foot traffic, hansom cabs and early motorcars.The lovingly detailed plaque features a period photograph of this astonishing site, the steam locomotive running at street level surrounded by tenements, horses and children. It reads, “These old bricks and beams will never forget…In memory of the hundreds of people killed by freight-liners on 10th Ave.” The Death Avenue line circled back on 11th Avenue, with another operating on the East Side of Manhattan on 4th Avenue. Long before the subway lines and the elevated railroads, these deadly engines killed and mangled pedestrians by the dozens, with public outcry coming from the citizens of Hell’s Kitchen, Chelsea, and the West Village, which largely fell on deaf ears.Operated by the Hudson River Railroad, at one point the company, in one of the more peculiar chapters in New York history, hired actual cowboys from the West to ride their horses in front of the trains waving a red flag to warn passersby. These so called “West Side Cowboys” couldn’t prevent the continuing fatalities and protests. In 1894, one Willie Lennon, who lost a leg to the trains, protested by lighting a bonfire on the tracks. In 1908, after the death of seven-year-old school boy Seth Low Hascamp, 500 school children marched against the train that had acquired the chilling name “the Butcher.”By 1908 it was estimated that some 436 New Yorkers had been killed by the trains. By 1929, the city agreed to elevate the railroad, beginning work on what is now the popular tourist attraction known as the High Line. Thousands of visitors everyday walk along the repurposed, once-abandoned railway line, with little idea of how it came to be.The somber plaque can be found on the brick wall of a charming restaurant and brewery on 10th and 29th, quite fittingly called, “Death Ave.”Sign up for our newsletter and get the best of Atlas Obscura in your inbox.",

          "description": "Part art installation, part social experiment, this strange sound in the middle of Times Square is not to be missed—even though it’s missed every day.Times Square has a few very noticeable features. Bustling crowds, bright lights, honking car horns and shouting vendors. The sights, sounds and sensations have long pleasantly overwhelmed unaccustomed visitors to the world landmark, even as they make local eyes roll.But one feature is known for being unknown. It’s a hum—a strange, hard-to-identify sound resembling a distant moving and clanking of heavy machinery or some other technological machination not found in natural settings. It’s deliberately concentrated on a singular pedestrian island in the middle of the busy intersection, and the most observant of passersby will undoubtedly notice it.In fact, the noise is deliberate. Rising up from what seems to be beneath the street, the hum was originally an art installation by Max Neuhaus, called Times Square, created in 1977 without signage or notification essentially to see if anyone on the world’s busiest street would notice. And like any piece of unmarked art meant to catch the attention of the public, almost no one did notice.The hum has since become a tradition, and the stuff of legend, as almost anything that lasts for decades with little formal marking does. It was finally removed by the artist in 1992, only to be restored once again by a collaboration headed up by the Dia Art Foundation.And thus there it remains: The strange, unavoidable, barely noticeable humming noise heard by thousands of people each day with only a minute portion of them actually noticing.Some people say art isn’t art unless it makes a statement. Times Square fits this criteria, even if its statement is a constant stream of nothing, noticed by no one.Sign up for our newsletter and get the best of Atlas Obscura in your inbox.",

But before that, the Shinran Statue stood proudly outside of a temple in Hiroshima, Japan, in 1945.More specifically, the statue stood only 1.5 miles from the center of the atomic blast that decimated 70 percent of the buildings in the city and took the lives of 150,000 people. Amazingly, the statue emerged from the explosion unscathed, still standing guard at the burning temple.Following the war, a Japanese man shipped the statue to New York where it has stayed since 1955. The statue has been free from radiation since it began its stay in the United States and has never posed a danger to visitors.Today, the 15-foot bronze statue stands as a monument to world peace and the frightening power of the atomic bomb. Its weathered bronze exterior is visible in front of the Buddhist Church, and its amazing legacy is preserved in the nation responsible for its near destruction.Accessible on foot from the 103rd Street Station on the 1 train.Sign up for our newsletter and get the best of Atlas Obscura in your inbox.",

          "name": "Lenin Statue at Red Square",
          "description": "There are many monuments to Vladimir Ilyich Lenin in the world. The likeness of the Bolshevic leader, Marxist revolutionary, and head of the Soviet Union is recognized as far north as Svalbard, as far south as the South Pole, as far east as India and Vietnam, and as far west as Seattle, Washington. But there is a slightly twisted irony to the fact that the leader of the proletariat revolution and proponent of socialist equality wound up on the roof of an expensive luxury apartment building, arm raised, saluting the one and only New York City–perhaps the ultimate monument to capitalism.The building, called Red square, upon which Lenin’s giant metal feet are planted, is owned by a former professor of radical sociology, Michael Rosen. This particular likeness of Lenin was created by Yuri Gerasimov, who was commissioned to build it by the Soviet Union, but because of the Union’s collapse, the statue was never unveiled and remained so until 1994 when Rosen’s partner bought it from the artist and had it installed on the roof. Since the construction of Red Square, Rosen has focused on building housing for battered women and those afflicted by AIDS, perhaps putting the spirit of Lenin slightly more at ease.Update, July 2017: The statue has been relocated to a building on Norfolk  Street, overlooking the ABC playground. Accessible from F Train at 2nd Avenue StationSign up for our newsletter and get the best of Atlas Obscura in your inbox.",

          "name": "New York Produce Exchange Property Marker",
          "description": "Hidden away down a rarely traveled tiny back alley in Lower Manhattan, there is a small property marker set into the pavement. Well-worn and most likely missed by anyone visiting the Financial District, it reads: “Property of New York Produce Exchange - Passage By Permission Only.” It is, sadly, all that remains of what was once one of New York’s grandest buildings.The Produce Exchange, built in 1884 looking down over Bowling Green, was one of the finest buildings in the city. The colossal Beaux Arts masterpiece was built in red brick, with vast arcades and Florentine touches. Designed by George Browne Post—whose work included the New York Times Building, the New York Stock Exchange, as well as the first buildings to use elevators—the Produce Exchange was the first building in the world to use both masonry and wrought iron, and featured an elongated skylight looking down on the main trading floor, restaurants, a library and offices. The New York Times called it, “the most impressive exchange structure ever seen in Manhattan.”The Produce Stock Exchange did a roaring trade, mostly in wheat and oil, over $15 million a day by the end of the 19th century, in an atmosphere Harper’s New Monthly Magazine described as a “callithumpian discord with fiendish screeches.”But the trend to modern, sleek skyscrapers took its toll on the colossal Florentine building, and it was torn down in 1955 to make way for a featureless office block. In his book Lost New York, Nathan Silver sums up the travesty perfectly, writing “the Produce Exchange, one of the best buildings in New York was replaced in 1957 by one its worst.” Today, Marketfield Street is so obscure as to render it virtually invisible. A small, L-shaped, narrow, grimy street, it starts at Broad Street before heading into the gloomy, dank, half-block-long alleyway. The street may be light on foot traffic, but it is long on history; it was originally known as Marckveldt, and led to the old Dutch cattle market that was held in the 1630s on what is today known as Battery Park. There was once a church there, the first Huguenot Church built in Manhattan, which was torn down to make way for the enormous Produce Exchange building 200 years later.The small property marker can be found near the L-bend, and is all the remains of what had been one of Manhattan’s most beautiful buildings.There are two markers on the street: one by a hydrant and the other by the garage doors.Sign up for our newsletter and get the best of Atlas Obscura in your inbox.",

          "description": "The tramway from Manhattan to Roosevelt Island is one of the most spectacular ways to travel in New York City. The gondola zips over the East River, leaving the city’s iconic skyline in its wake. But traveling to Roosevelt Island wasn’t always an aerial affair. A lone kiosk under the Queensboro Bridge is a forgotten reminder of the area’s shuttered street trolley system.Starting in 1909, beautiful Beaux-Arts kiosks serviced a trolley line which ran from Second Avenue in Manhattan and from Queens on the other side of the East River. The trolleys would stop on the bridge, where riders could descend by elevator to Roosevelt Island, which back then was known as Welfare Island because of the many hospitals located there.There were once five kiosks, ornately decorated with copper roofs and colored, glazed tiles. When the street trolleys stopped running in 1957, three of the structures were sadly demolished. One was moved in the 1970s to the Brooklyn Children’s Museum, where it also faced being destroyed. Saved by the Roosevelt Island Historical Society, it was restored and transported back to the island, where it currently serves today as a visitor center.Only one of the old kiosks can still be found in its original location, on Second Avenue between 59th and 60th streets, just underneath the bridge and tramway. The green and white structure is fenced in on a traffic island, where it sits empty, forlorn, and largely unnoticed amid the constant traffic crossing the bridge. The stairs no longer lead to the old trolley line, which was replaced by roads, and the doors marked “Entrance” and “Exit” remain unused, no longer witnesses to a steady stream of pedestrians.The unused kiosk is on a no-man's land traffic island with no pedestrian paths that allow easy access to it. Be very careful if you attempt to cross the street to see it as there is fast-moving traffic getting on and off the bridge here. The second kiosk is on Roosevelt Island and is used as a visitor center.Sign up for our newsletter and get the best of Atlas Obscura in your inbox.",

          "description": "Looking to establish a place where up and coming graffiti artists could hone their craft in a safe space, Harlem community leader Ray “Sting Ray” Rodriguez dubbed the concrete walls of the Jackie Robinson Educational Complex’s schoolyard to be the Graffiti Hall of Fame, and it has been attracting some of the best street artists in the world for more than 30 years.Originally creating his semi-unauthorized gallery in 1980, Sting Ray and his supporters meant it to be a place where graf artists could come and practice their skills with a spray paint can during a time when the art itself was moving away from simply scrawled tags to bright, expressive murals. Each of the school yard’s four walls both in the grounds and out were fair game.Today the ethos has changed with the motto of the site being, “Strictly Kings or Better,” and a rotating cast of internationally renowned street artists visiting the Hall of Fame and leaving a piece. Now the walls are usually covered in clean, dare it be described as professional, pieces of graffiti. Despite graffiti’s often maligned reputation, the Hall of Fame has brought enough attention to the school complex, which houses four separate schools, that the school yard itself has been renovated and is now just as clean as the writing on the walls.   Sign up for our newsletter and get the best of Atlas Obscura in your inbox.",

          "description": "Mysteries have always been around and always been popular, but they haven’t always been respected. Otto Penzler has had a significant hand in that transformation. He’s probably the most important figure in the history of mystery fiction who’s never written a mystery story. You get into Otto Penzler’s New York office through a door in the Mysterious Bookshop, the world’s oldest and biggest bookstore focusing on mystery, crime fiction, espionage, and thrillers. The door is roped off with a big X made of yellow police tape reading CRIME SCENE DO NOT CROSS. Down a flight of stairs, his office is a low-ceilinged basement cube with floor-to-ceiling bookshelves on all four sides, stocked with anthologies and first editions as well as a random sampling of mass-market hardcovers and paperbacks. If the office was a store by itself, it would be the second-best mystery bookstore in the world. Penzler is the owner of the Mysterious Bookshop (founded 1979) as well as The Mysterious Press, a publishing imprint he founded in 1975, and mysteriouspress.com, his ebook publisher. He has published most of the greats of mystery and crime fiction: Raymond Chandler, James M. Cain, James Ellroy, Ross Thomas, Patricia Highsmith, Ross Macdonald, Ed McBain. Any of the major authors he hasn’t published are probably at least good friends of his.The Mysterious Bookshop itself. Today the store is down in Tribeca, on a block that doesn’t suggest anything important in the literary world. It’s next to a Le Pain Quotidien and a few doors down from a 7-Eleven. (It was first located on 56th Street in Manhattan, in a building Penzler owned because it was cheaper to buy—New York was different back then.) Inside, every square inch of walls leading up to what must be 20-foot ceilings are packed with any book in which someone violently dies. There is an entire section for Sherlock Holmes books, including the many spinoffs written by dozens of authors. There are copies of long-defunct detective magazines like Black Mask. There is an entire section for what Penzler calls bibliomysteries—mystery books involving mysterious books. Murdered librarians, valuable manuscripts, that kind of thing.The bookstore is not twee. There are no props, aside from the caution tape; no pranks, no cute designs or artworks. This is a temple to the noble mystery, a place where people who can name all of Donald E. Westlake’s pseudonyms talk about one of the most enduring genres in the history of literature.Sign up for our newsletter and get the best of Atlas Obscura in your inbox.",

          "description": "The corner of 10th and A in Manhattan’s East Village is hardly the place one would expect to find a beautiful piece of medical history, but tucked in the back corner of Obscura Antiques and Oddities is a piece of history and part of an anatomical revolution.The early 1800’s were a frustrating time to be a medical student. Corpses were difficult to obtain, illegal to dissect, and without refrigeration one had to work fast before the corpse began to decompose. Wax anatomical models were available for study but they were expensive, fragile, and by no means meant to be handled by mere medical students. What the medical world needed was cheap, durable anatomy models.Louis Thomas Jérôme Auzoux, a young French medical student, was strolling down the streets of Paris when he saw the answer. The toys sold to children on the street were durable, lightweight, and could be modeled into any shape. The answer was papier-mâché. The young student began working on an anatomical model immediately. By creating a secret papier-mâché mixture containing calcium carbonate and powdered cork, he made the models exceptionally strong.In 1822, the year of his graduation, Auzoux presented his first anatomical model to the Paris Academy of Medicine and five years later he opened his own papier-mâché anatomical model factory. He produced beautiful anatomical models, and later zoological, veterinary, and even botanical models. Unlike the wax models, they were durable, and even better, they could be taken apart into all their individual organs and then reassembled. The models, and Auzoux, became a huge success.Tucked away in the back of Obscura Antiques and Oddities stands a full Auzoux medical model. Apparently, it is a later Auzoux model made from resin rather then papier-mâché, weighs a ton, and has a distinct, but not unpleasant, sweet smell in the heat of summer.Obscura is a fantastic and charming store containing an astonishing variety of medical antiques, turn-of-the-century taxidermy, “memorial photographs, medical art prints, taxidermied pets, shadow boxes, fraternal organization memorabilia, prosthetic limbs, Victorian mourning jewelry, magic lantern slides, collections of pinned insects, funereal ephemera, stereoscopic cards, carnival castoffs, two-headed fetal pigs, a jar of worms, corsets, top hats, glass-fronted cabinets, Victorian vitrines,” and many other delightful odds and ends. The owners are friendly, knowledgeable, and enthusiastic about the curiosities they sell.Sign up for our newsletter and get the best of Atlas Obscura in your inbox.",

          "description": "The first New York City subway was built and operated by the Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT) and opened on October 27, 1904, to the joy of New York elevated train and streetcar riders.The City Hall station on the IRT local track was lavished with fine architectural details, including glass tiles and large chandeliers. However, the Gustavino vaulted ceilings and skylights were lost on busy commuters, and the stop was one of the least-used in the system. It was the only station that did not have turnstiles installed by 1923, and the nearby Brooklyn Bridge stop was frequented by the express train and closer to connecting streetcars.Because of the curved platform, cars with center doors could not be used at this station unless they had specially modified door controls which allowed just the end doors to be opened. In 1945, the station was closed when platforms along the line were being lengthened to accommodate longer trains, and the number of passengers using this station dwindled to very few.Another factor leading to the decline of the station’s use was the fact that a person boarding the train at City Hall with a station intended destination below City Hall or in Brooklyn would wind up on the uptown platform at the Brooklyn Bridge station. They would then have to go upstairs and down to the downtown platform to continue their journey. It was much easier to walk the short distance at street level to the Brooklyn Bridge station.Up until the late 1990’s the passengers on the Lexington Avenue Local (today’s 6 train) had to disembark from the train at the Brooklyn Bridge stop. That is no longer the case. The skylights have been reopened, and the station lights turned back on. While passengers can not get out of the train and experience the City Hall Station as they once might have, they can stay on the train as it loops around on those tracks and heads back north.The New York City Transit Museum hosts periodic tours of the abandoned station; however, you must be a member of the museum to attend. Check the website for details.If you will be staying on the downtown 6 train after it leaves the Brooklyn Bridge station, it is best to be in the 7th, 8th or 9th car as the train operates very slowly around the curve in front of the City Hall station.

          "description": "No one knows exactly how it happened or how it could have been helped, but one thing we all know for sure is that the way Nikola Tesla’s life ended was tragic.This brilliant innovator, outstanding intellectual, and visionary fondly known now as the “man who invented the twentieth century,” died alone and destitute, never to enjoy the fruits of his labor or wide recognition for his genius. Tesla, Father of (insert countless groundbreaking inventions here), ended his life alone and broke at the New Yorker Hotel, in Suite 3327.These days, Suite 3327 has a plaque bearing Tesla’s name, and a second plaque honoring him graces the exterior of the hotel. Engineers, scientists, geeks, UFO enthusiasts, and other admirers all make the pilgrimage here to pay homage to the “mad” scientist who changed the world before the world was ready. Tesla spent ten years in this room, slowly losing his mind, falling in love with pigeons, and occasionally meeting with dignitaries.Besides being the place Nikola laid his head to rest for the last time on this earthly plane, the dour room on the 33rd floor is also the site of a conspiracy. Tesla kept a safe in this suite, and it’s where he stored his most controversial and important scientific papers. One of the more intriguing inventions was “Tesla’s Death Ray,” the culmination of his work on particle beams. While he had shopped the weapon unsuccessfully to several governments both as the “Death Ray” and the “Peace Ray,” he swore it could not be stolen as the blueprints were only in his head. In his words: “[The nozzle would] send concentrated beams of particles through the free air, of such tremendous energy that they will bring down a fleet of 10,000 enemy airplanes at a distance of 200 miles from a defending nation’s border and will cause armies to drop dead in their tracks.”On the day after Tesla died, his nephew hurried to the New Yorker and upon arrival found that his uncle’s notebooks and several papers had been removed from Suite 3327, along with the inventor’s body. A short time later, all of his work was impounded and passed through a handful of government agencies until the War Department deemed them worthy of “Top Secret” status.Some believe he was murdered by the FBI, despite his age and health being consistent with a natural death; some think he was an alien, and he simply returned to the mothership. The rest who mourn the loss of the quirky Serbian genius feel a palpable sadness knowing that the “man who invented the 20th century” left this life mad and misunderstood, sharing his bread and honey with the pigeons, fading in a lonely New York hotel room.This 1929 Art Deco icon currently operates as The New Yorker, A Wyndham Hotel. Located in Midtown West, it offers upscale rooms and suites (including infamous suite 3327), 24-hour dining at Tick Tock Diner, event space, and birdseye views of central New York City from the Sky Lounge.Sign up for our newsletter and get the best of Atlas Obscura in your inbox.",

          "name": "Marilyn Monroe's Subway Grate",
          "description": "On the southwest corner of Lexington Avenue and 52nd street is perhaps the most famous subway grate in the world.It was on this spot, at one in the morning on September 15th, 1954, that Marilyn Monroe had her white halter dress blown up over her hips by an uptown 6 train while filming The Seven Year Itch, creating not only one of the most iconic images of American cinema, but of Marilyn herself.Billy Wilder’s romantic comedy starred Tom Ewell as a frustrated publisher of pulp fiction, whose wife and children escaped the Manhattan summer heat for Maine. Left alone in the simmering city, he befriends his upstairs neighbor, played by Monroe in one of her defining roles as a ditzy glamour model. For the subway scene, the unlikely couple had just been to the Trans-Lux theatre on Lexington, to see the “Creature from the Black Lagoon.” Hearing an approaching subway train, Monroe stepped onto the grate, having her skirt blown high by the train passing underneath, saying “ooh do you feel the breeze from the subway, isn’t it delicious.” Minds across the country were simultaneously blown. In reality, the scene was a publicity stunt orchestrated by 20th Century Fox’s marketing department. Leaking the time and location of the event to the press, somewhere between 3-5,000 spectators showed up to catch a glimpse of Marilyn’s legs. The resulting noise made the shot unusable to Billy Wilder, and the street and scene was recreated later on a Hollywood set. But the nighttime shoot created the desired effect, the photographs from Lexington Avenue were used to publicize the film, and made their way onto the movie poster. Watching amongst the baying crowds that night was her husband, Joe DiMaggio. Less than impressed with the exhibitionist scene, they argued violently back in their suite at the St. Regis. Weeks later Monroe filed for divorce.The Trans-Lux theatre has long since gone, and today the French restaurant Le Relais de Venise is the backdrop to where Marilyn caused such pandemonium in the early hours of September 15th. Her iconic white ivory cocktail dress, designed by Oscar winner William Travilla, stayed in his private collection until it was auctioned in 2011 for over five million dollars. But the subway grate is still there, unmarked and rarely noticed, unless by a lady who happens to get caught by the air of a passing downtown 6. Sign up for our newsletter and get the best of Atlas Obscura in your inbox.",

          "description": "In the early 1900’s the two buildings once known collectively as Saks-34th Street were one of New York’s glitziest shopping hubs, and they were connected with an equally opulent span now known as the Gimbel Bridge.After retail giant Gimbel’s purchased the Saks Company in 1923, they became one of New York’s largest retailers, along with Macy’s. Always in competition with Macy’s, whose massive flagship store was just a few blocks uptown, the new conglomerate solidified their position by connecting their 34th Street store to Saks’ Fifth Avenue location with a grand skybridge.Built in 1925, the second story bridge was designed by architectural firm Shreve and Lamb who would go on to develop the Empire State Building just a few years later. The skywalk is suspended over 32nd and features an Art Deco, copper facade that has turned a vibrant green with the passing of time. The bridge is in itself almost its own building at three-stories tall and featuring wall to wall windows on either side so that people could watch the streets below.Once open to shoppers, Gimbel’s bridge now connects private floors of its terminus buildings, but visitors rushing to Penn Station can look up and remember a New York where dueling department stores could produce architectural wonders.Sign up for our newsletter and get the best of Atlas Obscura in your inbox.",

          "description": "Seen everywhere from Rome, to Ukraine, to Paris, the tradition of placing padlocks on bridges to symbolize love has finally appeared on New York’s Brooklyn Bridge.Started some time in the 1990s, the tradition of locking engraved padlocks has proliferated around Europe to the point that it has become a serious form of vandalism in certain cities. The symbolic act often sees a couple mark their name on a standard padlock and affix it to a piece of public infrastructure (usually a bridge or fence) and then throw the key away (often into the water under the bridge). The unlockable symbol is now free to represent the couple’s love for as long as the public site remains (or until the city sends officials out to cut the locks off, which is likely a more accurate representation of a relationship’s duration). The ritual is not dissimilar from carving initials into a tree, but when there aren’t very many trees, a historic suspension bridge will have to do. Since the locks are damaging to the bridge, they are regularly removed. However, a group of lock pickers has been active in working to remove them first and preserve them rather than have them discarded. Best to walk at sunrise, not sunset. Significantly fewer crowds, and the sunrise reflects off the buildings of lower manhattan.Sign up for our newsletter and get the best of Atlas Obscura in your inbox.",

          "description": "Think of public bathrooms, and the mind conjures images of grimy walls, wet floors, and stinky, dirty toilets. But you won’t find any of those features in this Beaux Arts building, which hides a rare restroom oasis. The building is home to what may be the most luxurious public bathroom in all of New York City. Funded by private donors, these tiny toilets (with only two stalls for men and three for women) offer those with full bladders an unusually pleasant public bathroom experience. Guests are greeted by fresh flowers, paintings of the park made by artists-in-residence, and even bathroom attendants, all set to a background of curated classical music. Large frosted glass windows let light gently spill into the space. The toilets, sinks, and other fixtures are the same luxury brand used at the MoMA.The building, which is a historic landmark, underwent a roughly $300,000 renovation in 2017. It’s clear the donors weren’t flushing funds down the toilet, as pedestrians seem to appreciate the upscale commode.It’s been said that park employees are regularly sent to scout out bathrooms in the Waldorf Astoria, the Plaza, the St. Regis, and other luxury locations to scope out the competition. Anyone with a taste for luxury is free to make use of the toilets, though be forewarned, lines to get in can be pretty long.Bathroom attendants don't accept tips.\nSign up for our newsletter and get the best of Atlas Obscura in your inbox.",

          "description": "In most places in New York City, people try to keep rats out. It follows, therefore, that the only architecture in the city that welcomed rats into the design is still a kind of monument to keeping rats at bay.The Graybar Building, built in 1927, was designed to pay tribute to New York City’s position as a key transportation hub, with its trains (the building is right near Grand Central Terminal) and its seaport. The cables that connect the canopy in front of the exterior to the building itself are made to look like the mooring lines of a ship.And as with real mooring lines, these mooring lines have rats climbing up them, attempting to get into the “ship” that is the Graybar Building. The rats are thwarted by conical structures called baffles near the top of the lines that stop the sculpted rodents from getting all the way to the building, as they would stop rats from entering ships.The Graybar Company was headquartered in this building from 1927 until 1982, when it moved to St. Louis, Missouri. Recently, the company opened a sales office in its old building. The building has also housed companies like Remington Rand, CBS, and Conde Nast.As the 20th century ticked on, the rats disappeared from their mooring lines, but during the building’s restoration in the late ’90s, a special note was made to “replace [the] missing rats.” And so there they are, once more, still unable to board the ship. The architects had one more little joke, though: The carved rosettes that the mooring lines lead to depict the heads of clever rats that, presumably, made it on board before the baffles were put in place.Sign up for our newsletter and get the best of Atlas Obscura in your inbox.",

          "name": "The Woolworth Building",
          "description": "Frank Winfield Woolworth five-and-dimed his way to the top of the world, and he did it in style.When the Woolworth Building opened in 1913, President Woodrow Wilson pressed a button in the White House, and 80,000 light bulbs flashed to life on Broadway as Thomas Edison supervised. Then Edison joined a banquet for 900 other prominent guests that the New-York Tribune called “the highest dinner ever held in New York.” During the ceremonies, famed radio pastor Samuel Parkes Cadman made “cathedral of commerce” the skyscraper’s nickname for the ages.Over 100 years later, much of the original glory remains, though the general public wouldn’t know it. Master architect Cass Gilbert’s Gothic gem still gleams in lower Manhattan, but few tourists have been inside in recent years. The building’s owners for the past couple of decades closed it to casual visitors. Post-9/11 security restrictions didn’t help, either. But that’s starting to change.Thanks to the efforts of Gilbert’s great-granddaughter, Helen Post-Curry, the owners allowed private tours in 2013 for the building’s centennial celebration. A great response led to regular paid tours. The tours focus almost entirely on the lobby—in addition to the aforementioned unfortunate closures, the 57th-floor observation deck was shut down during World War II out of fear that enemy spies could exploit its harbor views—but the lobby contains plenty to illuminate the Woolworth’s soaring story.One need only look up at the grand Heinigke & Bowen stained-glass ceiling over the main stairs to grasp F.W. Woolworth’s animating vision. Border panels devoted to great empire-builders like Spain and Russia lie alongside others featuring the Woolworth “W” as well as 1913 for the building opening and 1879 for the opening of the first successful “Woolworth’s Great Five Cent Store” in Lancaster, Pennsylvania (a store in Utica, New York, failed in 1878, and Woolworth reused its sign in Lancaster).By 1910, the operation was humming along well enough for Woolworth to lay plans for a company headquarters that would be the tallest building in the world, surpassing the 700-foot Metropolitan Life Insurance skyscraper completed in 1909. Woolworth scrapped a more modest $5 million estimate, and the final bill of $13.5 million produced the 792-foot (and one inch) finished structure of 58 stories (or 80 conventional stories, since ceilings range from 11 to 20 feet). The retail baron paid for it all in cash—perhaps in nickels and dimes only, as some say, and perhaps not.It’s also said that Woolworth spared no expense on the construction. Yet despite the gaudy price tag, he couldn’t resist a bit of skimping (amusingly enough, Woolworth is counting coins in the lobby gargoyle that portrays him). The Tiffany elevator ornamentation is cast iron done up like brass, terra cotta masquerades as marble on the exterior, and interior marble touted as “Greek” was actually mined in Vermont. Woolworth hired Cass Gilbert to create a world-class, historic company monument, but he always had business in mind.“My idea was purely commercial,” he said in 1910. “I saw possibilities of making this the greatest income producing property in which I could invest my money.”The building’s construction was a media phenomenon, and Woolworth was surely pleased with its critical reception and popularity. Woolworth opened his crown jewel up just like his stores, with counters and eateries alongside plentiful retail outlets. Missteps were minimal, such as the German beer hall shunned by some patriots during World War I, though the war’s drain on construction did benefit the building overall—it remained the world’s tallest until 1930, when the Chrysler Building and then the Empire State Building were completed.The Woolworth Building finally left Woolworth hands in 1998 with a $155 million sale to the Witkoff Group, which launched a plan to turn the top 25 floors of the building tower into 34 luxury apartments. Most were offered for $7 to $10 million, though two listed at $20 million, and one seven-level “Castle in the Sky” penthouse had a city residential record $110 million price tag. The tower residences have a separate lobby and elevators as well as a restored lounge and an underground swimming pool.One wonders what the building’s namesake would think of these investment returns, not to mention the stratification of a tower rooted in mass consumption. Woolworth pursued power and status relentlessly, though, and he enjoyed his lofty position from opulent personal spaces on various floors. These included a Renaissance-style apartment on the 40th floor, private suites on the 25th floor, and a 24th-floor “Empire Room” office inspired by Woolworth’s deep Napoleon obsession. Designers there used Napoleonic palace decor, filled it with memorabilia, and made a replica throne chair to await a man who saw his stores as an empire and his staff as a military hierarchy.Unfortunately enough, Woolworth only reigned from what he called his “imperial capital” for about five years, dying at age 66 in 1919. If he were invited to the “Castle in the Sky,” he might marvel that his building is still breaking records and attracting the elite of a new gilded age. But perhaps he’d also insist on more foot traffic in the lobby.The Woolworth Building is closed to the public, but tours of the building's lobby can be reserved online. Currently, prices range from $20 for a 30-minute tour, $30 for a 60-minute tour, and $45 for a 90-minute tour.Sign up for our newsletter and get the best of Atlas Obscura in your inbox.",

Campbell decided he needed an office for both work and play, he knew he wanted it to be near the railroad for easy access to transportation. So what better place to install himself than in Grand Central Station itself?Campbell leased a space from William Kissam Vanderbilt II in 1923 and modeled it after a 13th century Florentine palace, going as far as installing a $300,000 Persian rug.Having fallen into disrepair through the years, it was eventually remodeled as a bar in the late 90s, replete with 1920s-era décor and drinks. Signs of Campbell’s lavish lifestyle still persist — just look to the fireplace where his beautiful steel safe resides.The bar crowd still consists of a lot of financiers and business commuters, so we can’t vouch for the crowd.

          "name": "The Morris-Jumel Mansion",
          "description": "High up on a hill overlooking the Harlem River lies not only Manhattan’s oldest home, but one of its supposedly most haunted, the stately Morris-Jumel mansion.The mansion was originally built in 1765 as the home of former British Army officer Roger Morris. When Morris fled America for England at the outbreak of the Revolutionary War, the house was confiscated along with other Loyalist properties by the Commissioners of Forfeiture. Following his defeat at the battle of Long Island in 1776, George Washington took refuge and set up his headquarters here, at the highest point in Manhattan.The house itself is a glorious example of preserved Palladian architecture. Its immaculate white framework is prominently on display atop Coogan’s Bluff, but it rests fairly anonymously way up in the Washington Heights neighborhood of Upper Manhattan, far from where most New York City tourists and visitors wander.After serving time as a popular tavern on the old Albany Post Road, the mansion was purchased by wealthy French merchant Stephen Jumel in 1810. It’s at this point in the venerable house’s history that tales of the macabre begin. Jumel brought with him his mistress, and then wife, Eliza Bowen Jumel. He remodeled the house in the popular Federal style of the time, adding a columned porch, and redecorating the interiors. At one point Stephen and Eliza were among the wealthiest families in Manhattan. They planted vineyards of Bordeaux grapes that still run wild today in neighboring Highridge Park.When they traveled to Paris, the Jumels were acquaintances of Napoleon and Josephine Bonaparte. But in New York, they were shunned by high society. Eliza came from a working-class Catholic family in Rhode Island, and cruel rumors circulated that she had worked as a child prostitute in her mother’s brothel. When Stephen Jumel died in 1832, the exact cause was unknown. Some reports had him dying from pneumonia, or from injuries sustained in a carriage accident. Others had him passing away after falling on a pitchfork. The gossip of the ladies’ parlors in Manhattan was that Eliza had opened up his dressings after the pitchfork incident and watched him bleed to death. A local medium claimed that Eliza had buried her husband alive.Regardless of how the unfortunate Stephen actually passed away, what is certain is that only months later Eliza took a new suitor: Aaron Burr, the highly controversial former Vice President of the United States who had notoriously killed Founding Father Alexander Hamilton in a duel in 1804. Despite Burr’s age (he was 77), they soon married in the front parlor of the mansion. The marriage was short-lived, however, and Burr died three years later on the exact day the divorce was granted. Eliza took to calling herself the “widow of the ex-Vice President of the United States.” Now fabulously wealthy, Eliza lived on in the giant house as a recluse, gradually falling into dementia. She was said to have walked the hallways and chambers of her mansion, her hair unkempt and her clothes soiled, haunted by the tortured souls of her past lovers. She died alone in the house in 1865 at the age of 90. The city of New York eventually purchased the mansion in 1904, and it was added to the National Register of Historic Places. Today, it’s operated as a museum with period-decorated rooms open to the public, an unusual old stately home tucked away in the hills of Washington Heights. Believers in the paranormal claim to have seen at least five ghosts inside: a serving girl, a British soldier from the Revolutionary War, the doomed Stephen Jumel, the figure of Aaron Burr, and most prominently, the figure of an elderly woman in a violet dress, the troubled old mistress of the house, Eliza Bowen Jumel.Sign up for our newsletter and get the best of Atlas Obscura in your inbox.",

The neighborhood once teeming with affluence, corruption, crime and secrets; so much so that across the street from Onieals was the police headquarters and an underground tunnel connecting the two; where uninformed police officers and city officials would access the speakeasy for some fun with discretion and ease. The tunnel was also used to transport bootlegged booze during prohibition. In the late 80s the police headquarters building was sold and converted into luxury condos. Today part of the tunnel can still be seen and is used as a wine cellar at Onieals.Accessible from 4,6,J,N,Q,Z at Canal Street StationSign up for our newsletter and get the best of Atlas Obscura in your inbox.",

          "description": "To the untrained eye, 77 Water Street looks more or less like any other unremarkable office building in New York’s Financial District.Take a closer look, however, and you might begin to notice some unusual elements. Like the WWI fighter plane that appears poised for takeoff from the runway on the building’s roof, or the functioning turn-of-the-century-style penny candy shop in the lobby 26 floors below where visitors can purchase a treat.Many a daydreaming office dweller has likely looked down from his window and speculated as to the plane’s history and how it came to rest atop a Wall Street high rise. Some might be disappointed to learn that the plane is no antique at all, but actually a replica modeled after a 1916 British Sopwith Camel. Also disappointingly, it didn’t arrive at the roof by way of a dramatic landing, but was instead placed there by crane in 1969, a year before the building was officially opened for business. The candy store below is likewise a replica, albeit a functioning one.According to Robert Kaufman, president of the New York real estate developer the William Kaufman Organization, the plane was conceived as a way give the folks in nearby condos and offices something interesting to look at. The candy store at 77 Water Street was incorporated into the lobby as part of Kaufman’s goal to humanize his building. On 77 Water Street’s website Kaufman states: “Our plaza is inviting, exciting, warm and friendly. It makes people forget they’re at an office building.”In addition to its offbeat offerings, 77 Water Street is home to more traditional decorative displays, including a variety of art installations. The William Kaufman Organization is famous for incorporating a touch of whimsy into its properties; across the island at 767 Third Avenue, another Kaufman building is adorned by the world’s largest chess board.For more information on “The Many Secrets of 77 Water,” Visit ScoutingNY.Sign up for our newsletter and get the best of Atlas Obscura in your inbox.",

          "description": "In 1888, the Lower East Side’s Moderation Society was very pleased to make the acquaintance of the deep-pocketed Dr. Henry Cogswell of San Francisco.The Moderation Society had been formed in 1877 to address the health conditions plaguing this particularly dirty, crowded segment of New York City. Top of mind for these reformers was the prohibition of alcohol, which they considered top of list in troublemaking. Temperance groups like the Moderation Society and the National Women’s Christian Temperance Union (which is still active today) blamed alcohol for the bulk of society’s woes, including crime, violence, and disease.After the Civil War, these groups supplemented their political lobbying with the construction of public drinking fountains, believing that part of boozing prevention was providing a free, clean, and readily available alternative. (At least some of the alcohol consumption around this time can be attributed to the fact that given the option between dirty city water and a beer, it’s easy to pick the beer.) And this is where the Californian dentist comes in.Henry Cogswell made a fortune in the California gold rush and then made temperance his hobbyhorse. His dream was to erect one temperance fountain for every 100 saloons in the country. He served as the Moderation Society’s honorary president in 1890 and their partnership produced two temperance fountains in New York City: this one in Tompkins Square Park and another at the post office at 34th Street and Eighth Avenue.Not only did Cogswell bankroll his fountains, he also personally designed them, with varying degrees of success. This one is entirely typical of his style, and—comparatively—not too bad. It’s a pillared stone canopy, topped by a somewhat-demoted figure of Hebe, the Greek goddess of youth. On Mount Olympus, she served nectar and ambrosia to the gods. In Tompkins Square Park, she serves water to the unwashed masses. Cogswell’s favorite virtues—Faith, Hope, Charity, and Temperance—are embossed on the sides of her canopy.The Tompkins Square fountain was better received than several of Cogswell’s creations. His gift to the nation’s capital was famously called “Washington’s ugliest statue” and spurred the creation of fine arts commissions in many American cities, so that officials would have a mechanism to refuse unwanted gifts of public art. The vast majority of Cogswell’s fountains have disappeared over time, but the this one seems destined to stay where it is—a hangover, if you will, from another time. The fountain is located nearest to Avenue A, below 9th Street.Sign up for our newsletter and get the best of Atlas Obscura in your inbox.",

          "description": "Greenwich Locksmith is the smallest numbered building in Manhattan, and at only 125 square feet could be easily missed from a distance. Dwarfed on 7th Avenue by expensive condos and fancy restaurants, the homegrown locksmith has been a unique Greenwich Village establishment for more than 30 years.A few years ago, an artist and the owner of the shop, Phil Mortillaro, began attaching keys in a pattern on the building’s door. The metal accents made a splash in the neighborhood and the locksmith started getting more attention. Building on this rising tide of local celebrity, Montillaro then built a chair completely out of keys in front of his store, and people went crazy.While the Village was known for its art scene years ago, the area’s dynamic has markedly changed. Unhindered by the new look of his old neighborhood and armed with a sky’s-the-limit attitude, Mortillaro set out to bring back art to Greenwich. Working painstakingly for two years, he bought keys by the pound from local scrapyards, and began to work on a larger project. Mortillaro wanted to cover the entire façade of his store with a patterned key design.Slowly, he welded the keys, of all shapes, sizes, and uses onto panels, and in 2011 finished a metallic interpretation of Van Gogh’s Starry Night and a Jackson Pollock influenced-pattern, which he mounted to the building. Since then, the locksmith has turned heads on 7th Avenue and reclaimed a bit of the artsy past of the area.Harkening back to a lost era in the Village, Mortillaro has left an impressive mark on the City, and has truly made his shop an exceptional establishment. Even more unique, and worth a look for visitors in the area is his studio, just a few feet away. Featuring more of his work with keys and other metals, Mortillaro’s studio is one of the last storefront art spaces in the city. Sadly, given real-estate value in the area it might not last for long.Christopher Street Station (1, 2 Trains).

          "name": "United Palace Theatre",
          "description": "The Wonder Theatres were five giant, lavish movie palaces that opened around New York City in 1929 and 1930. While cinemas were plentiful at the time, the Wonder Theatres were a cut above the rest. Built as Loew’s flagship theatres, the opulent venues were designed with all the fabulousness of the Jazz Age, and went on to provide an escape into the fantasy of Hollywood and luxury throughout the Great Depression and Second World War. The last of the Wonder Theatres to open was the Loew’s 175th Street Theatre, today known as the United Palace Theater. It debuted on February 22, 1930, with showings of the films Their Own Desire and Pearls and vaudeville performances starring Al Shaw and Sam Lee. The theater is a sight to behold. The lavish interior, much of which is filigreed, features authentic Louis XV and XVI furnishings and ornate chandeliers, while the blocky exterior is reminiscent of Mayan architecture. Its eclectic architectural style, designed by Thomas W. Lamb, was described by The New York Times as “Byzantine-Romanesque-Indo-Hindu-Sino-Moorish-Persian-Eclectic-Rococo-Deco” and a “kitchen sink masterpiece.” With more than 3,000 seats, it is still the fourth largest venue of its kind in Manhattan. Movie palaces eventually fell out of vogue, however, and the grand Wonder Theatres fell into decline and abandon in the late 60s and through the 70s. Today, two of the theaters (the Jersey Theatre in Jersey City and Kings Theatre in Brooklyn) still serve as cinemas and performance venues. Another two (the Paradise Theatre in the Bronx and Valencia Theatre in Queens) became churches. The United Palace Theater, located in upper Manhattan’s Washington Heights, found a second life as a unique mix of both. Soon after Loew’s closed the venue in 1969 (the last film shown was 2001: A Space Odyssey) it was purchased by televangelist preacher Reverend Frederick J. Eikerenkoetter II, aka “Reverend Ike.” He renamed it the Palace Cathedral, though it became known as “Reverend Ike’s Prayer Tower.”The restorations included fixing the “Wonder Morton” pipe organ, a feature of all of the Wonder Theatres, which had gone unused for 25 years. (It has since fallen out of use again due to water damage.) Reverend Ike made only one significant change to the structure, adding a cupola to the northeast corner of the building, topped with a “Miracle Star of Faith” that is visible from New Jersey.The former Wonder Theatre still functions as a church, as well as a movie house with a 50-foot screen, and a performance venue that has brought in acts as diverse as Adele, Bob Dylan, Iggy Pop, and the Berlin Philharmonic. It also serves as a cultural and community arts center, opened by Reverend Ike’s son Xavier Eikerenkoetter, who now oversees operations of the historic venue.Sign up for our newsletter and get the best of Atlas Obscura in your inbox.",

          "description": "Even in this internet age, finding much about Please Don’t Tell, a speakeasy on St. Mark’s Place, can be a bit difficult. Its website is one page with only a phone number to make reservations. Despite sharing space with Crif Dogs, a late night fried hot dog joint, its menu is unknown until entering (although there are still fried hot dogs). More importantly, just to get in, one must know the number to dial in the non-descript telephone booth.Of course, Yelp can provide all the answers, but that goes against the whole idea of the place. Find a friend (or a friend of a friend) who has been there and knows what to expect. That’s part of the experience.It can be easy to feel markedly out of place among the hot dog eating patrons of Crif Dogs. If you can get over your self-consciousness, and the line isn’t unbearable, PDT is a pretty cool experience. Enter the phone booth at the side of the restaurant, and wait, assuming you get through, because the coolest part of the experience is just seconds away.Accessible from 4, 6 Trains at Astor Place Station. Reservations are recommended as the bar is busy on most nights. Reservations are open by phone only at 3 p.m. daily. Without a reservation, expect waiting time for a seat to exceed an hour.Sign up for our newsletter and get the best of Atlas Obscura in your inbox.",

This Mexican restaurant serves up a delicacy punctuated with a growth most people are not accustomed. The corn-mold tacos, called huitlacoche, have become a crowd favorite, but has long been appreciated by the Mexican people.Huitlacoche is technically a corn infected by a pathogenic fungus and where you’d think farmers would lament there crops being covered in black spores they actually rejoice and can then charge a lot more for their product. The taste is corn like with a much more earthy quality like a mushroom.Toloache also servers another rare to find in the U.S. treat, chapulines tacos, a taco filled with Oaxacan style dried grasshoppers. Whether you’re feeling in the mood for moldy corn, seasoned grasshoppers or some of the other creative menu items, Toloache is a great place to explore another side of Mexican cuisine.Sign up for our newsletter and get the best of Atlas Obscura in your inbox.",

          "description": "In New York City, where space seems to be a luxury, as busy streets fill crowded edifices of offices and apartments, an abandoned nine-story building almost seems incredibly unlikely.Located just one block from City Hall, 5 Beekman Street is more than just an awe-inspiring structure; it is more like an inside secret. Tourists, businessmen and regulars pass it without knowing about the mystery behind its brick terra-cotta disguise. Having been vacant for nearly a decade with parts of it shuttered since the 1940s, this elegant building does not accommodate a single soul.Architecturally speaking however, it is physical testimony of some of New York City’s earliest surviving pre-skyscraper office buildings, being just the third building in the city to accommodate an elevator. This Victorian-style late 19th century building is one of few in Manhattan that has a full height atrium and skylight, embellished with detailed cast-iron railings and ceilings.For having been built in 1882, 5 Beekman Street is in superb condition. The preservation of this architectural wonder is due in large part to its long dormancy. In 1940 the atrium was boarded up with sheets of wood because of fire code regulations, but has since been brought back up to code. Unlike other frameworks from its time, it has not been modified or changed much, keeping intact a rich piece of history in the Big Apple.Update: The old building has been converted into a high-end hotel, open as of September of 2016. The lobby and restaurants within the hotel are publicly accessible.Sign up for our newsletter and get the best of Atlas Obscura in your inbox.",

          "description": "Located in a nondescript Midtown building right by Penn Station is New York’s own Houdini Museum.Dedicated to the escape artist Harry Houdini, the museum is housed in the Fantasma magic shop. Take the elevator up to the fourth floor, and soon you’ll suddenly be surrounded by hundreds of objects from Houdini’s history.There are of course handcuffs and straitjackets, as well as impressive objects like his 1907 escape coffin from which he emerged in 66 minutes after it was secured with six inch nails (illustrations of the achievement line the wooden casket). Numerous framed photographs and posters line the wall, along with curiosities like an x-ray of the bullet in his hand. A cabinet displays some of the objects from Houdini’s career in debunking spiritualism which he saw as a misleading use of magic. In a corner is his last metamorphosis chest, and alongside is a plaster bust of the magician that once stood on his grave in Machpelah Cemetery in Queens. The items are mainly from the private collection of Fantasma’s CEO Roger Dreyer. About two hundred objects are on display, with 1,500 in storage, so the exhibitions regularly change out to show different artifacts. The magic shop is actually right in the museum, so along with the fascinating display from the legacy of one of magic’s greatest figures you can try out tricks yourself and make some purchases to propel your own career in illusions. Watch for the sign for a magic shop and take the elevator up to the fourth floor.Sign up for our newsletter and get the best of Atlas Obscura in your inbox.",

          "description": "The SeaGlass Carousel in New York City’s Battery Park is housed inside a glass-paneled nautilus shell that sits atop the site of the original New York Aquarium.Opened in August 2015, the carousel is the creation of the Battery Conservancy and George Tsypin, a renowned opera and theater designer who is the man behind the staging of LaScala operas, the Sochi Olympics, and the Spider-man Broadway musical. Constructed as a public-private project, it took 10 years and several million dollars to bring the SeaGlass Carousel to life.The SeaGlass Carousel features 30 fiberglass fish spotlighting 12 different species, while the mechanics are unique in that there’s no traditional center pole. By putting individual motors for each fish below the floor, the riders have unobstructed views while the fish both spin independently and swirl around each other as though swimming through the ocean.Rides of the SeaGlass Carousel will also experience a changing LED light display that makes one feel as though they are truly underwater. To add to the overall experience, each fiberglass fish contains its own speakers that play aquatic sounds and music specifically composed for the ride. Each of the fish in the carousel is modeled after an actual species ranging from tall angelfish to the much smaller clown triggerfish. No matter which you choose, it will resemble one underwater lifeform or another that can actually be found out in the oceanThe SeaGlass Carousel is located in Manhattan's Battery Park and is easily accessible by several New York City subway lines, including the 1, R, and W. The carousel can also be reached via the M5, M15, M15 SelectBusService, and M20 bus to South Ferry.The SeaGlass Carousel is open seven days a week from 10 am to 10 pm. Tickets cost $5 USD, while children 12 months and younger ride for free. Before visiting the SeaGlass Carousel, it is advised to check the carousel's Facebook page for any unexpected closures due to weather. Sign up for our newsletter and get the best of Atlas Obscura in your inbox.",

          "description": "The largest accumulation of gold in human history is located deep underneath the heart of Manhattan’s financial district, at the New York Federal Reserve Bank. Some 80 feet beneath sidewalk level, the Fed’s special vault is built in bedrock and entrusted with deposits from central banks across the globe. Inside sits 7,000 tons of glittering gold bars—around 5 percent of all of the gold ever mined.The only way into the vault is via a cylindrical entryway that rotates at the turn of a wheel. A sliver-shaped pie chunk of the cylinder has an opening, that when properly aligned with the entry hallway allows access to the treasure inside. Inside there are 122 separate mini vaults (one for each different country), plus a “library vault” for account holders with smaller deposits. The Fed considers each gold bar as a non-fungible individual because of variations in purity and weight. As a result they carefully track each of the deposits, so if you give them a particular bar you can later retrieve that exact one. The Fed’s gold vault really doesn’t cater to millionaires and billionaires, though; the customers are sovereign nations. While the list of account holders is a closely guarded secret, think of the likes of Bank of England, Banque de France, and Deutsche Bundesbank. Foreign countries store their gold in New York for the benefits of convenience and centrality. One of the perks of centralizing everything in one spot is that countries can transfer gold amongst themselves by simply moving bars from one compartment to another, at a modest handling cost of $2 per bar.Perhaps the most amazing thing about the New York Fed gold vault is that it offers public tours (although the website says that new bookings are currently unavailable). That’s a remarkable feat considering the security at similar facilities like the Gold Bullion Depository at Fort Knox, which bars the likes of reporters, members of congress and former presidents.Fulton street Station on the 2,3 or 4,5 Trains.

Although this is not your typical dream house with a 4-door garage, it guarantees to be a one-of-a-kind experience, with its completely absorbing, constantly fluctuating sound waves accompanied by neon pink reflections of light.Created in 1993 by modern composer La Monte Young and visual artist Marian Zazeela (who are married to one another), this is the culmination of 40 years of their work. Zazeela explains that “together, the sound and light can be experienced as a new form or new media: the sound and light environment. The experience of the two mediums together as one requires a new, or at least different, mode of attention.” For example, unless you are completely still, be prepared to encounter a new collection of pitches with every move you make, as you encounter the various resonating sound fields created by Young.Young and Zazeela invite you to dive into their dream world, Wednesday through Saturday from 2PM-Midnight. Admission is $10.00– walk right in.Update August 2018: There is a restaurant at this address now.Sign up for our newsletter and get the best of Atlas Obscura in your inbox.",

          "description": "At the dawn of the 20th century it didn’t take as much effort to garner the attention of the buying public as it does today, but the core principle remains the same: novelty. The titular owner of William Barthman Jeweler had a clear grasp of this concept when he and an associate installed a working clock into the sidewalk outside their store.Barthman, along with one of his employees, Frank Homm, created the timepiece in 1896, but not as it exists today. The original clock was a mechanical jump hour clock with the numbered tablets that would flip over on the hour. It also had a little light bulb that would illuminate the clock at night. In the beginning, as passersby trampled across the clock face it was met with surprise and delight by turn-of-the-century shoppers. Unfortunately the fatal flaw of the original contraption was that it was custom designed by Barthman and Homm, and they were the only ones who knew how to fix it. Thus when the clock began to malfunction in later years, the attraction became an embarrassment, and the operators of Barthman’s store would cover it with cardboard each day to hide their shame.Unable to make the clock work with Homm’s special touch (Homm passed away in 1917), the only solution they could come up with was to replace the clock entirely. The new clock was a more traditional analog dial, ringed with a classy brass compass rose. With the installation of the new clock, and the lucky popularity of a photographer’s snapshot of the clock, the sidewalk novelty that had vexed them for years had once again become a popular feature for Barthman’s. The sidewalk clock still sits outside of Barthman’s on the corner of Broadway and Maiden Lane in lower Manhattan, just as it has for a century. It is estimated that over 50,000 people walk over the timepiece each day, not once stopping to ask the time.  Sign up for our newsletter and get the best of Atlas Obscura in your inbox.",

          "description": "According to Bleacher Report, there is one basketball court, and one alone, that is “without a doubt the most famous basketball court on the planet.” The outdoor, two-hoop court of Rucker Park, complete with five rows of bleachers, may not look so famous from the outside. But over time it has been touched by the shoes of some of the NBA’s greats, and witnessed some of the most intense street games of all time.Rucker Park, in northeastern Harlem, was first built in 1950 by Holcombe Rucker, the playground director of Harlem’s parks. Rucker opened the court in order to start up a legendary basketball tournament amongst Harlem’s greatest street ballers, nicknamed the “Rucker League”, with a generous mission of providing both basketball skills and educational opportunity to the low-income youth of the neighborhood. To encourage academic growth, Rucker gave playing priority to students with higher scores on their report cards, and his generous educational efforts eventually granted college scholarships to 700 Harlem youth. With the motto of “each one, teach one”, Rucker donated most of his spare time to help with homework and teach reading to the kids.But Rucker’s legacy wasn’t limited to education: Rucker Park soon became the one-stop shop for emerging basketball players to gain their street cred and boost their playing ability to the NBA level. In over six decades of existence, the Rucker League’s tournaments have been competed in by greats such as Wilt Chamberlain, Dr. J, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, and, most recently, Kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant.Over the years, Rucker Park has not only hosted some of basketball’s greatest players, but also some of its greatest moves. At a time before the NBA was filled with slam dunks and crossover dribbles, Rucker Park was the international epicenter of jams and jukes.As of today, Rucker Park is open to the public and is often occupied throughout the day with a match of street ball. Since the fifties, the Rucker League has held onto its educational initiative and currently offers mentoring, tutoring, and career planning to Harlem’s economically disadvantaged children. In fact, the late Holcombe Rucker has created so much positive change in the community that his grandson is currently asking the NBA to admit his granddad into the Basketball Hall of Fame.Sign up for our newsletter and get the best of Atlas Obscura in your inbox.",

          "description": "When Henry H. Bliss stepped down from a trolley car on September 13, 1899, he had the historic misfortune of stepping directly in front of an electric-powered taxicab. In doing so, he became the first motor vehicle fatality in the Western Hemisphere.A plaque now marks the spot at West 74th Street and Central Park West where Henry Bliss met his end. At the time, this notoriously accident-prone stretch was known by local motorists as the “Dangerous Stretch” on account of the many accidents that had taken place there the previous summer.The unfortunate Bliss, a real estate dealer, had stepped down from the trolley car and turned to assist his companion, Miss Lee. While doing so, he was run over by an electric taxicab driven by Arthur Smith (electric-powered cars were surprisingly common back then). The New York Times, reporting on the incident, said that “Bliss was knocked to the pavement, and two wheels of the cab passed over his head and body. His skull and chest were crushed.”Gory details aside, the report also managed to squeeze in some juicy social gossip. The passenger in the cab, Dr. David Orr Edson, was the son of former New York City mayor Franklin Edson. Dr. Edson tried to assist Henry Bliss while waiting for the ambulance to arrive, but ultimately to no avail. Upon arrival at the hospital, Bliss was deemed too severely injured to survive.He became the first motor car fatality in the Western Hemisphere. He died 30 years after the first ever known automobile fatality, that of Mary Ward, an Anglo-Irish naturalist, astronomer and author. She died in 1869 under the wheels of a steam car built by her cousins.As for Arthur Smith, the driver of the electric cab, he was arrested and charged with manslaughter. But Bliss’ death was later deemed unintentional, and Smith was acquitted.Exactly one hundred years later, on September 13, 1999, a safety-awareness organization named Citystreets placed a plaque at the site. It reads:“Here at West 74th Street and Central Park West, Henry H. Bliss dismounted from a streetcar and was struck and knocked unconscious by an automobile on the evening of September 13, 1899. When Mr. Bliss, a New York real estate man, died the next morning from his injuries, he became the first recorded motor vehicle fatality in the Western Hemisphere. This sign was erected to remember Mr. Bliss on the centennial of his untimely death and to promote safety on our streets and highways.”The memorial ceremony was attended by the great-granddaughter of Henry Bliss, who placed flowers at the site.Sign up for our newsletter and get the best of Atlas Obscura in your inbox.",

          "description": "Unlike other “abandoned” train stations in the New York City area, the infamous Track 61 is supposedly still in use as a secret escape train for presidents visiting the city.Built along with the rest of Grand Central Terminal, Track 61 was never properly abandoned, as it was actually constructed to be a powerhouse and storage area for unused New York Central Railroad cars, not a passenger station:  Contrary to popular belief,  Track 61 is not part of the NYC Subway but rather part of the New York Central Railroad, now Metro-North.The station is not much to look at, what with all the untended grime and dirt, but there is still an antique train car permanently parked in the hidden powerhouse. However, the dingy industrial stretch of track has managed to gain a fair amount of fame as the private transport stop for US presidents.The earliest reported use of the track was during the tenure of Franklin D. Roosevelt, who supposedly had his car transported to the station. The car was then lifted right into the Waldorf’s garage. Roosevelt is also rumored to have entered and exited via the station in order to hide his worsening case of polio. Track 61 likely hid the comings and goings of a number of Presidents over the years and was confirmed to be prepped for a quick getaway route for George W. Bush while he took meetings at the Waldorf.Everyone from military generals to celebrities have been said to use Track 61 for any number of clandestine movements, but given the amount of secrecy involved, all are hard to confirm. However, the unmarked brass door at the Waldorf’s street level which leads to the station is proof that someone important is still using the track.   Sign up for our newsletter and get the best of Atlas Obscura in your inbox.",

          "description": "Where can a person see a butter churn, an 1,800-year-old metal fire starter, and a 1901 cylinder phonograph all in one place? Anywhere, because the Museum of Interesting Things is built to travel.Headquartered in Manhattan’s East Village, the museum is the brainchild of Denny Daniel, a freelance filmmaker and photograph restorer who wanted to use his vast collection of fascinating antique devices to inspire curiosity and innovation.He started with small demonstrations in his apartment, and as people showed more and more interest, the project grew and began to travel. The exhibit is organized by categories, like Math, Science, and Literature, which he takes to schools—elementary through university—as well as hospitals, libraries, and galleries. Any space that is big enough for him to set up a few tables for his antiques is fit for the exhibit. Visitors are encouraged to handle some of the items, to experience what it was like to use them, and make suggestions. (That’s how the collection ended up with three 8-track players.)The idea is to remind people of today that something like the iPhone did not come from nowhere, but evolved over time from history’s innovations. This point is probably driven home when visitors bring out their smartphones to take pictures of his wind-up wooden box telephone. More recently, the exhibit has grown to include several “green power” items, including a crystal radio, which was powered by nothing more than radio waves. The traveling show can also be viewed at its headquarters in New York if pre-arranged by phone.

          "description": "190 Bowery looks abandoned, forgotten, covered in trash and graffiti on an otherwise well-maintained major street in Manhattan. A hulking six story, 72-room mass built as the Germania Bank Building in 1898, today the structure is a single family home.It’s the American Dream as a house, a building that went from rags to riches on a street once known for its murders, now known for its centrality. Photographer Jay Maisel broke the bank when he bought the bank in 1966 for $102,000. Back then, the Bowery wasn’t a place you went so much as ended up, and the main floor (now a basketball court) was allegedly knee-deep in garbage and coated in soot, with “every single thing that can come out of a human body” left on the doorstep. Maisel’s parents cried. Today, the bohemian castle may look deceptively decrepit on the outside, but inside it’s a dream. A home-made ventilation system (to deter the insane expense of what central air would cost in such a space) consists of a network of plastic tubing throughout the building. The original 1898 copper cage elevator still works, the second and third floor are gallery spaces, the  fifth floor has various workshops (including a room dedicated to Mylar-window shades), the sixth floor has bedrooms, bathrooms, and the kitchen, and the roof a wowing view of lower Manhattan.The family occasionally finds new rooms, and take-out is a “riot”, since no right-minded delivery boy believes such a hulk houses just four people.Today, 190 Bowery is estimated of having a worth anywhere between $30 and $70 million, and is certainly in the running for best property snag of all time.Care to take a look inside? Maisel teaches private photography classes in his home, but it’ll cost you $5,000.Update September 2016: This place has been sold to be turned into high-end office space. Sign up for our newsletter and get the best of Atlas Obscura in your inbox.",

          "description": "When former President Ulysses S. Grant was diagnosed with throat cancer in 1884, the topic of the disease and its incurable nature became a point of national discussion. That same year, the cornerstone of this unique historic building in New York City was laid at 455 Central Park West.This bold and unusual piece of architecture on the Upper West Side is also a reminder of a fascinating bit of U.S. medical history. The building was formerly the New York Cancer Hospital, the first U.S. hospital built specifically to research and treat the disease.At the time of Grant’s diagnosis he was living in Upper Manhattan, and a group of prominent wealthy New Yorkers including John Jacob Astor banded together to found the Cancer Hospital. The disease was misunderstood and highly stigmatized at the time, thought to be contagious and shameful. Upon the dedication of the hospital Grant’s physician helped inform the public that cancer wasn’t caused by bad habits or sanitation but could affect anyone, rich or poor. When Grant died the following year, it further raised awareness of the disease and kicked into motion efforts to find a better treatment or cure.The building’s unique design — it’s often remarked it looks more like an art museum than a hospital — helped serve this purpose. Brownstone towers were constructed on the exterior, creating circular wards that allowed better observation of and access to patients. The round design was also intended to stop germs and dirt from accumulating in corners and air shafts were installed in the center each tower to deter stagnant air.  Due to the number of patient deaths, a crematorium was installed in the basement; the haunting smokestack is still visible today.The hospital was the site of many medical innovations. By 1899, the name changed to General Memorial Hospital for the Treatment of Cancer and Allied Diseases and it served as a hub for research on radiation therapy in the early 1900s. The practice eventually moved to its current location on the east side of Manhattan, known today as the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center.The brownstone building, meanwhile, became a nursing home and like much of New York City went into decline and closed in 1974, but was designated a historic landmark in 1976. Today the building hosts mostly luxury condominiums, but it lives on as a striking piece of late 19th century gothic architecture that marks a crucial turning point in the history of public health.Sign up for our newsletter and get the best of Atlas Obscura in your inbox.",

          "name": "The Ramble Cave",
          "description": "In New York City’s Central Park, just below the 79th St. Traverse, lies a heavily wooded area, interwoven with narrow, winding trails, and dotted with large granite boulders. While The Ramble, as it’s known, may appear to be the most natural place in the city it only appears that way thanks to the efforts of Central Park’s planners Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux, as well as the original builders of the Park who put in countless hours constructing a landscape that would seem rustic and remote.  But for all their hard work, Central Park has changed.  Like everything else in New York City the Park is constantly evolving, but if you know just where to look you can still find traces of its original features. One of the more interesting cases is that of the long-lost Ramble Cave.The Ramble Cave was not part of Olmsted and Vaux’s ‘Greensward Plan’, their design for what would become Central Park. They did lay out the Ramble, complete with paths and trees, but to construct their artificial wilderness required a lot of construction and excavation.  It was during one such dig that a large deposit of “rich mould” was found in a small bay on the north side of The Lake (‘mould’ in this case being extremely fertile soil, not what you find on bread that’s been sitting on your counter for too long).  The mould was carried away, cart-full by cart-full, revealing a narrow cavity, at water level on the lake-side and sloping uphill thirty feet or so to the north, meeting up with a planned path just to the east of the Ramble Arch.While the cavity was certainly an interesting find, it didn’t quite fit the look that Olmsted and Vaux were going for, nor was it easily accessible from the elevated lake-side trails.  To solve the first problem, several large rocks were set on top of the eastern wall with more stones set into the hill beside the north exit, giving the impression that they had slid down naturally.As for accessibility, at the southern exit, by the Lake, rough stones were laid out to form a narrow staircase leading from the lake-side path down into the cave, with a border of larger stones hiding the stairs from view except from above. The cave was a popular attraction in the Park, with one early guidebook calling it “a great attraction to boys and girls, and hardly less to many children of a larger growth.” Later in its life it would become known as the ‘Indian Cave’, supposedly because the floor showed evidence of early Native American inhabitants, though evidence of this is hard to find. Early sources refer to it simply as “the cave” or “the Ramble Cave”.Sadly, it was also a popular spot for trouble. In 1904 a man was found near the steps, shot in the chest, supposedly the victim of a suicide attempt (the man, Samuel L. Dana, would recover, but the incident and its mysterious aftermath would set off a media frenzy).  In October, 1929 the Times reported that 335 men had been arrested in the Park just that year for what they generously termed “annoying women”, with the Ramble Cave held out as a particularly popular spot.  Sometime in the 1930s the Cave was sealed off. The entrance by the lake was simply bricked up while the opening by the Ramble Arch was more elaborately sealed and covered over with dirt to make it appear as just another hillside in the Ramble.The steps by the Lake are still there however. Unless you know of their existence they, and the Cave, they are the easiest things in the world to walk past, blissfully unaware of this once lovely feature of a young Central Park.On the western side of the Ramble, just below the Ramble Arch. The stairs are on the west side of the second small bay at the northwest of The Lake.Sign up for our newsletter and get the best of Atlas Obscura in your inbox.",

          "description": "Brazenhead Books is a bookstore located inside a private apartment, existing just outside the laws of retail, where a sense of impishness and wonder pervades the air. Once inside, the beloved bookshop’s owner, Michael Seidenberg, delights in entertaining visitors with a meandering tale of Brazenhead’s earnest conception. Begun in a sub-sidewalk retail space on Manhattan’s Upper East Side, located just a few steps below street level, its current reincarnation is now in a semi-undisclosed location in Midtown.Even in its earliest form, as a non-secret retail bookstore Brazenhead was adored by its patrons. However the fanaticism of the bibliophile crowd wasn’t enough to stave off skyrocketing rent, forcing Seidenberg to take move his operation underground in 2008.  Hilariously, this move involved taking Brazenhead’s stock several stories upward, into Seidenberg’s apartment. Away from the prying eyes of city zoning officials, the bookstore settled into its most permanent, legendary existance, where the man and his wares shared a living space 24/7. Inside this world where proprietor and books existed side-by-side, patrons were free to come and go as they pleased, so long as they made an appointment. Seidenberg would also throw open his doors to host the occasional party by invitation only, whose attendees were largely those of a creative and literary type. Gradually, word of mouth turned Brazenhead into a bona fide speakeasy of books, with publications ranking it among the most stunning bookstores anywhere on Earth.  By late 2015, however, Seidenberg was once again facing the potential death of Brazenhead when an eviction notice forced him out of the apartment that had been his and Brazenhead’s home for so long. Yet, as the curtain lifted the following year, Brazenhead had, against all odds, once again magically resurrected. This time it finds a new life in a secret Midtown location.Despite its move, this laissez-faire atmosphere of the salon-book-party remains at Brazenhead’s new location, where Seidenberg still cohabitates with many precious volumes, all for sale at a range of prices accessible to the common man and collector alike. Once again bibliophiles’ secret temple is open for pilgrimages, so long as one is willing to put in the legwork to make an appointment with Seidenberg, whereupon Brazenhead’s exact address will be disclosed.Open by appointment only.

          "description": "Few diseases have had a greater impact on the history of human civilization than smallpox.The bubonic plague certainly wins for its baroque presentation. Malaria and HIV are concurrent with our times and thus feel more real. But smallpox takes the contamination cake. It has been around for more than 3,000 years in all parts of the world.Before the vaccine was discovered in 1796, more than 400,000 people a year died from smallpox in Europe alone. According to the World Health Organization, smallpox killed one in ten children in Sweden and France and one in seven in Russia.The disease killed Louis XV of France and other European monarchs. Queen Elizabeth I had the disease as a child and wore heavy make-up to conceal her pockmarks. In the French and Indian Wars, blankets containing smallpox were purposefully given to Delaware Amerindians, in an early instance of biological warfare. Through extensive worldwide vaccination efforts, the disease was eradicated in 1979 - the only disease to be completely eradicated through human intervention.By the end of the 1800s, efforts were made in Western Europe and the United States to eradicate the disease by universal vaccination. But before that time, many cities built hospitals specifically for treating smallpox sufferers.In New York City, the southern tip of Blackwell’s Island (now Roosevelt Island) provided ferry access but kept the infected patients far away from the population. Better known for Grace Church on Broadway and St. Patrick’s Cathedral on Madison Avenue, James Renwick Jr. designed the smallpox hospital in his Gothic Revival style. From 1856 until 1875, the hospital treated about 7,000 patients a year. In 1875, the building was converted into a nurses’ dormitory, and the city smallpox hospital was moved to North Brothers Island, in part because Blackwell’s Island had become more densely populated. By the 1950s, Renwick Hospital had become useless and was abandoned by the city, quickly falling into disrepair.However, in 1975, the Landmarks Preservation Commission took interest in the dilapidated structure and declared it, in its ruin, a city landmark. They reinforced the walls to prevent it from completely falling apart but have not renovated it or opened it for tours. Only some of the outer walls and the foundation remain today. It is behind a fence on the southern tip of Roosevelt Island.Take the F to Roosevelt Island. Walk south along West Road to E Road. The hospital will be on your right. You can also take the tram from Manhattan, or the ferry from Astoria, Long Island City, or Wall Street.Sign up for our newsletter and get the best of Atlas Obscura in your inbox.",

Although easy to miss, the dark mannequin is actually sporting the dress of the Leopard Society, a 19th-century gang of sorts that clawed unsuspecting travelers and fed upon their flesh.Hoping it would make them stronger, the Leopard Society roamed Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Côte d’Ivoire, preying upon strangers and distributing the meat from their bodies among their tribe. Society members would wear the skins of leopards and fashioned weapons from their claws and teeth.Legends of the Society grew much larger than the real impact of its members after a report in the Royal Journal of Africa, and depictions of the warriors in a Tarzan novel. Despite rumors that the society was still active throughout the 1980s, the last remaining trace of the Leopard Society hangs quietly above ignorant museum-goers in New York City.The garb can be found in the hall of African Peoples, directly above an exhibit labeled “Science and Faith”Sign up for our newsletter and get the best of Atlas Obscura in your inbox.",

          "name": "Trinity Place Bank Vault Bar",
          "description": "Down in the heart of the New York financial district there is a bar hidden inside an old bank vault from 1904.The basement vault at the Trinity Place bar and restaurant was originally commissioned by the New York Realty bank. Built by the Mosler Safe Company in upstate Hudson, New York, the vault was so large and heavy it had to be sailed down the Hudson river and then transported on purpose built railway tracks from Battery Park to its home at 115 Broadway. The vault was unusual in that it had two entrances at either end, with each door weighing in at 35 tons. Restored from its dusty condition in 2006, the vault is now home to a swish bar befitting its distinguished surroundings. At each end of the bar, the original five inch steel walls have been left exposed so cocktail sipping visitors can have a sense of how secure the old vault was. At the far end of the bar is a restaurant converted from the old meeting room of the bank’s executive board complete with its original chandelier.Whilst the hidden bar is undoubtedly dignified, the building, which was built around it is even more so. 115 Broadway was designed by Francis Kimball as the US Realty building along with its sister building next door at 111, the Trinity building. New York’s original twin towers, the two matching buildings were unusual for skyscrapers of the time, in that they were designed in a strong gothic style. The two narrow and long buildings are lavishly decorated with gargoyles, buttresses, pinnacles, turrets, dragons, and eagles. Closely built next to each other, with a steel footbridge connecting the two, permission was given by the city to actually move the adjoining Thames Street 28 feet to the north, to allow the two buildings to nestle side by side. Walking into the near identical lobbies, the coats of arms, ribbed ceilings, stained glass, and monk’s heads would leave you thinking that you had wandered into a medieval English cathedral. The New York Times in 1907 called the two buildings towering over lower Broadway, “twin examples of Gothic splendor.”The 20th floor was even once home to the old Lawyers Club, a society so extravagant that it kept a private herd of 50 cows in New Jersey to provide its members with their own supply of fresh butter. But whilst the basement of 115 revels in its luxurious bank vault bar, the story next door couldn’t be more different. The basement steps of 111 lead to a Subway franchise and the former home of a bar called Suspenders. Once a local neighborhood staple run by the Fire Department, the bar served as a refuge for firemen during the 9/11 attacks. Part of the fabric of the local community for 27 years, the bar sadly closed its doors in the early summer of 2014. But next door, the bar in the basement vault is still keeping good business and is surely one of New York’s sturdiest and most secure places in which to enjoy the cocktail of your choice. Sign up for our newsletter and get the best of Atlas Obscura in your inbox.",

At least that’s the myth at the Chinatown Ice Cream Factory, and whether or not it’s true, the Seid family has certainly perfected the art.For nearly 30 years, the Factory has been offering a cold treat and has grown wildly popular due to their unique flavors. Wasabi, black sesame and peanut butter and jelly are just a few of the one-of-a kind ice cream options at the Chinatown institution.

          "description": "When Howard Otway bought the Theatre 80 in St. Marks in the 1960s, he had little inkling of what secrets lay within. Once a movie house specializing in showing classic films, and now a lovely, well appointed neighborhood theatre, the building had a storied history he had barely discovered.Renovating the theatre in 1964 Otway found a bunker-like maze of tunnels in the basement, including two safes. He called in a safe cracker to find $2,000,000 in gold certificates, unfortunately expired. As it turned out his theatre was once a thriving clandestine speakeasy ran by the previous owner and gangster, Walter Sheib.In its day, entrance to the secret club was gained from the butcher shop around the corner on 1st Avenue. There was once an elevated railroad with a station right at the corner of 1st and St. Marks, and with all the crowds of passengers, those in search of an illegal cocktail could slip into the butchers shop unseen. At the back of the shop was a tunnel which led between the buildings and into the backstage of the dancehall. The butcher shop is now an Afghan restaurant, but the building’s windows still sag from the lack of foundations, caused by the tunnels.Today the theatre is owned by Otway’s son Lorcan. As well as the theatre, he has converted two rooms upstairs into a lovely little museum dedicated to the gangsters who owned and operated the speakeasy and many others like it across the country. On display are one of the cracked safes, bullets recovered from the St. Valentine’s Day massacre, moonshine stills, and medicinal prohibition whiskey. Entrance to the museum comes with a tour through the theatre and down into the basement tunnels as well. Down in the basement there are still the original telephones that ran between the speakeasy and the warehouse where the illegal booze was stored. Also on display is a complex series of wires, showing where Walter Scheib had rigged up the building with explosives, so in the event of a raid, he could detonate all the evidence!The theatre also includes a bar, The William Barnacle Tavern, where intrepid Gangster enthusiasts can begin and end their tour with one of the most complete ranges of absinthe available in the city.It’s estimated that in the height of prohibition there were over 30,000 speakeasies in the city, and this is one of the authentic ones still left. A charming character, Lorcan Otway has done a brilliant job in preserving this hidden gem tucked away in the East Village.Sign up for our newsletter and get the best of Atlas Obscura in your inbox.",

          "description": "Despite being one of the most famous islands in the world, there is a small part of Manhattan that actually makes up part of mainland America; the quaint neighborhood of Marble Hill.Named after the dolomite marble deposits visible on the stoney crags overlooking the Hudson River,  Marble Hill, whilst physically part of the Bronx, is technically still part of Manhattan. For the citizens of Marble Hill, it is a controversial dispute started by an engineering solution to the problem of Manhattan’s busy water ways in the late nineteenth century. With dense shipping overcrowding the Harlem and Hudson Rivers, the two waterways were finally connected in 1895 by the building of the Harlem Ship Canal. It cut through Manhattan’s northernmost neighborhood, Marble Hill, immediately turning the latter into an island, cut off from Manhattan on one side by the new canal, and from the Bronx on the other by the old Spuyten Duyvil Creek. Marble Hill kept its proud island status until 1914, when the old creek was eventually filled in, making it physically part of the Bronx, but still legally part of Manhattan. A dispute over the neighborhood caught between two boroughs has raged ever since. In March 1939, Bronx Borough president James Lyons climbed the hilltop at 225th Street and planted a Bronx flag, claiming the neighborhood be subservient to his borough, calling it the “Bronx Sudetenland”, referencing Germany’s recent annexation of part of Czechoslovakia. The proud Manhattanite citizens of Marble Hill booed him down, and petitioned the city Governor to make sure they remained part of Manhattan. The petition was settled in 1984 declaring the neighborhood once and for all part of Manhattan. Today, Marble Hill itself still resembles a quaint village. Small wooden one and two bedroom family homes, built in the Queen Anne style with porches and gardens, nestle alongside each other on the winding, steep streets that still bear the Dutch names of its original founders. The unusual curved streets follow the path of the filled in, old Spuyten Duyvil Creek, giving Marble Hill its atypical feel. As recently as 2014, the so called “Great and Glorious Grand Army of the Bronx” planted their borough flag again in Marble Hill, demanding that the residents declare their “loyalty to the mightiest, most glorious and obviously, most handsome, borough and county of The Bronx,” only for Manhattan borough President Gale Brewer to retort that, “On the 75th anniversary of its would-be annexation by the Bronx, I am happy to declare that the flag that flies over Marble Hill is still that of the Manhattan archipelago”.For the several thousand residents who proudly call Marble Hill home, it’s a debate that has raged since the canal was built creating their idiosyncratic neighborhood over 100 years ago. Sign up for our newsletter and get the best of Atlas Obscura in your inbox.",

The park was constructed in 1971 by the Greenacre Foundation after a design by Hideo Sasaki, but it feels fresh even decades later where the honey locust trees and rare Midtown calm lure people to linger in its shade. Accessible from 4,6 Trains at 51st Street Station or E,M Trains at 53rd and Lexington Station, located on East 51st Street between Second and Third AvenuesSign up for our newsletter and get the best of Atlas Obscura in your inbox.",

          "description": "Deep in the subway system below Times Square and passed by thousands of commuters and tourists everyday lies an unnoticed white door.Tucked away on the eastern end of the platform of Track 1 on the Grand Central-Times Square-42nd Street shuttle, the anonymous looking white door is similar to the many doors that can be found on MTA stations. But where those lead into utility rooms, workers offices, and generators, this white door holds a glamorous secret.Atop the door is a faded metal sign which simply says “KNICKERBOCKER,” and behind it lay a secret entrance to the bar of what was once one of New York’s most splendid hotels, John Jacob Astor’s Knickerbocker hotel.Above ground, on the corner of Broadway and 42nd Street, the Knickerbocker was a beaux arts masterpiece. Built with Astor’s millions in 1906, it had over 500 rooms, with space in the restaurants and bars for 2,000 revelers.The hotel was the centre piece of the gilded age of old Times Square, with a 30 foot mural of Old King Cole and his Fiddler’s Three painted by Maxfield Parish hanging over the bar, and where Martini di Arma di Taggia is rumored to have invented his famous namesake cocktail in 1912, it was such a haven for refined elegance, it was commonly known as the 42nd Street Country Club.When John Jacob Astor died on the Titanic his son took over, but the hotel fell out of favor when prohibition swept the nation. Parishes’ mural was moved to the St. Regis Hotel, and the building was converted into offices for Newsweek magazine. Where once F.Scott Fitzgerald and John D. Rockefeller drank, the ground floor now houses a Gap store, but plans are afoot to reopen as a luxury hotel in late 2014. But as yet there are no plans to open the secret back door to what was once one of Manhattan’s finest jewels. Head for the eastern end of the platform of Track 1 of the 42nd street shuttle at Times Square.Sign up for our newsletter and get the best of Atlas Obscura in your inbox.",

          "description": "Bordering the southern boundaries of Chinatown, on the edge of what was once the infamous hive of poverty and villainy known as Five Points, there is a small, red brick house that was once home to one of the era’s more barbaric entertainments.Madison Street runs for 16 blocks through the Lower East Side of Manhattan, and is still dominated today by tenement buildings and housing projects. Lodged between two such tenements is number 47-49 Madison Street, a building that visually seems to pre-date it’s surrounding neighbors, and has a gruesome history to go with the looks.Today the former home is used as a prayer hall for the St. James church around the corner, but 160 years ago this small building was one of Manhattan’s infamous “rat pits.” An advertisement in the March 2, 1853 issue of The Herald summed up what went on in these cruel dens, crowing, “Rat Killing, and other sports, every Monday evening. A good supply of rats kept constantly on hand for gentlemen wishing to try their dogs, with the use of the pit gratis, at J. Marriott’s Sportsman’s Hall, 49 Madison Street.”Rat killing was the premiere gentlemen’s betting sport of the mid-19th century. The boys of the Bowery were paid 5-10 cents for each rat collected, and spectators crowded into the hall to bet on how many rats the fighting dogs could kill in a given time span. Nearby on Water Street, Kit Burns, one of the last original Dead Rabbits gang, ran a similar infamous octagon rat pit. Behind closed doors all over the area, the debauched pastime thrived, with politicians and well-to-do society members coming downtown to gamble amid the saloons and slums of the Five Points.In 1850 the house on Madison was bought by an English ex-pat named Harry Jennings, who ran the saloon and kept up its barbaric sport until he was sent to Riker’s Island for robbery. Upon his release Jennings turned somewhat respectable, becoming one of the cities pre-eminent rat catchers, providing extermination services for such lofty locales as the Plaza Hotel.Despite the history of blood sport, the former saloon is now home to a prayer hall which is much beloved by the locals. Recently in danger of closing and being sold for real estate, the parishioners lobbied for the funds to save their aging church and its adjoining little building with the checkered past. And now when the church doors close at night, the faithful retire around the corner to the small brick house on Madison Street to meet and pray, providing a rather redemptive end to the story of a building soaked in the blood of rats.   Sign up for our newsletter and get the best of Atlas Obscura in your inbox.",

It’s a museum where you’re actually encouraged to not just touch, but actually play the exhibits.The Babycastles art collective began in 2010, roaming between locations throughout New York but usually showcasing events and exhibits at Silent Barn in Brooklyn. After settling into a permanent Chelsea home in 2014, the collective could host musical performances as well as more frequent revolving art shows.The concerts included all genres—lots of electronic and chiptune acts, but sometimes more obscure, self-proclaimed “nerdy” acts like The Doubleclicks too. It’s not just music either. The venue puts on poetry readings and live theater as well, like the immersive fantasy musical The Universe is a Small Hat. To top it off, Babycastles functions as a coworking space during daytime hours.The art collective extends itself throughout the city in the form of pop-up installations called “Lil’ Babycastles.” They keep with the mission of promoting game culture, in all its mutations, through art and design.This theme remains Babycastles’ bread and butter, with a popular game of the month lecture series and rotating exhibitions. The collective also does collaborations, like a Gaza-inspired exhibit done with Art Palestine International or a collection of games created by students at Parsons School of Design. Game themes have included sex, race, feminism, Islam, and more lighthearted subjects like roleplaying as a mechanic.Babycastles is located on 14th Street between 6th and 7th Avenue; the closest trains are the 1/2/3 and L on 7th or the PATH train to New Jersey on 6th. It's also quite walkable from Union Square, where you can catch many more trains like the N/Q/R/W and the 4/5/6.The gallery is open Monday–Friday from 9 AM to 5 PM. Events will usually take place in the evenings on Friday and Saturday and may ask for a modest donation ($7-$12) at the door.Sign up for our newsletter and get the best of Atlas Obscura in your inbox.",

          "name": "High Bridge",
          "description": "High Bridge is a steel arch bridge that spans the Harlem River, connecting New York City’s Manhattan and The Bronx. The bridge was completed in 1848, nearly 11 years after construction began, and stands 140 feet high and over 2,000 feet long. The height of the bridge was a decision of the New York Legislature, who worried that a low bridge would obstruct boat traffic, so they ultimately decided that a higher, more expensive bridge was necessary.High Bridge was built as part of the Croton Aqueduct, New York City’s first reliable and plentiful water supply system, which carried water 10 miles south of the Croton River. The aqueduct had to cross the Harlem River at some point along its route south, so the Water Commission decided it best to utilize a bridge to do so.In 1928, the historic masonry arches that spanned the river were demolished and replaced with a single steel arch of about 450 feet in length. The arches were removed to create space under the bridge for easier boat navigation. However, several of these masonry arches of the original 1848 bridge still remain on either side, with only one on Manhattan and ten on The Bronx.City officials considered closing the bridge in the mid-1960s, nearly 120 years after initial construction, because of disrepair. However, the bridge was not closed until 1970 when a pedestrian threw a rock from the bridge and damaged a tour boat.In 2009, the city began preliminary planning to restore the High Bridge as a pedestrian and bicycle greenway. After years of restoration efforts, costing over $60 million, the bridge was reopened to the public in June of 2015.The fresh new bridge walk is modern and inviting, although the same can only somewhat be said of the sprawling park land beneath the span. Highbridge Park continues to be an unwieldy and often neglected urban nature spot with illegal dumping, overgrowth, and homelessness still an issue. Efforts are underway to restore the park itself however with invasive species being slowly (and literally) weeded out, and new facilities such as a skate park being installed. With luck, it won’t take decades for the park to catch up with the bridge above it.  Sign up for our newsletter and get the best of Atlas Obscura in your inbox.",

          "description": "Graffiti artist Chris “Freedom” Pape first came to the Amtrak tunnel in 1974 and started spray painting- not as a form of rebellion, but as a way to express himself through his artwork.The tunnel was created by Robert Moses in hopes of increasing mobility to the Upper West Side residents, although his highway expansions blocked off the river. The undertaking was poorly executed, and was planned  just as the automobile craze caught on, so it was soon abandoned. The homeless eventually began to call it home, and street artists came to tag the open canvases that were the tunnel walls.In 1991, Amtrak reopened the tunnel, leading to a mass eviction of the hundreds of homeless people that lived there. In 2009, Amtrak started repainting the tunnels, causing most of the graffiti murals to be lost.Freedom was a highly respected graffiti artist, with his murals left untouched by other taggers and his restoration of Goya’s “The Third of May” mural within the tunnel itself. The tunnel was once again alive with color and art, and Freedom’s work stands out as an example of an art form slow to gain respect, but undoubtedly worthy.It is considered trespassing on Amtrak property to walk on these tracks, which is a federal offense. If you do decide to risk it, be aware that you may run into nefarious company, and be wary of standing on or near the tracks, as they are currently in use.intersection of St. Clair's Place and Off-ramp of Hudson ParkwaySign up for our newsletter and get the best of Atlas Obscura in your inbox.",

          "description": "The legend of the West Side Cow Tunnels has long been a part of urban myth, repeated by someone who heard, but never from someone who knew. The story goes that sometime in the 1870s, the need to alleviate cattle traffic in the streets resulted in the creation of an underground ″Cow Tunnel″ beneath 12th Avenue and 34th Street.From there the stories fluctuate wildly. Everything from where the tunnels are — some people put the location of the tunnels on Joralemon Street — to what exactly the tunnels were made of —  with oak, steel, and fieldstone all being candidates.One of the only published accounts of the tunnels comes from an old article from the Tribeca Tribune in June of 1997, which follows the wild goose chase of a Con Edison employee as he tracked the vague leads of his friends who knew a friend who saw the tunnels. In the end, the myth of the West Side Cow Tunnels seemed to be just another urban fancy.That is, until 2004, when hints of the legendary Cow Tunnels resurfaced. An archeological report from the NYC Landmarks Preservation Commission and the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation, and Historic Preservation mentioned underground ″Cattle Tunnels″ at 34th Street and 38th Street. The tunnels are believed to have been built for the West Side slaughterhouses. According to the New York Times, a report from 1847 cites cattle being herded to their deaths underground along 34th and 35th Streets, as well as 12th Avenue. Unfortunately, if the tunnels are still there, they may be lost under the Javits Center. Sign up for our newsletter and get the best of Atlas Obscura in your inbox.",

          "description": "Locals who drop by the Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine in New York City know to keep an eye out for the its most glamorous patrons: its three peacocks. Harry, Jim, and Phil, who were named after prior heads of the church, are beloved members of the community. Phil, the white peacock, even has his own Twitter account.But what the birds didn’t have was a fancy home that suited their style. Until 2017, that is, when the cathedral gifted the peacocks with a new, updated hutch.The peacocks’ old abode was a shabby plywood structure, which was somewhat of an eyesore unbefitting of such beautiful creatures. A competition commenced in 2014 to design a new home for the fancy fowl. The winning hutch was officially opened during a blessing ceremony.Now, Harry, Jim, and Phil can retire to their own state-of-the-art home, complete with pointed arches and windows that pay homage to the cathedral’s Gothic architecture. The walls are lightweight and yet insulated enough to keep the peacocks warm at night. The cathedral even plans to install an extra step in front of the entrance, as the peacocks are developing arthritis in their old age.The three birds arrived on the cathedral grounds in the early 2000s. Visitors can watch the birds strut around the gardens, where they’re known to flash their feathers. Those passing through the neighborhood can hear their squawks, especially during mating season.The cathedral, which is known for its annual Blessing of the Animals, has kept peacocks since the 1980s. Its gardens also house an urban honey bee sanctuary.Sign up for our newsletter and get the best of Atlas Obscura in your inbox.",

          "description": "New Yorkers are generally well off when it comes to communing with nature. From the giant municipal Central and Prospect Parks to outdoor spaces such as Bryant Park and Riverside Park, the city provides all manner of welcome escapes from the urban jungle. But much less well known is an actual tropical jungle hidden away on East 43rd Street. What makes it so remarkable is that it is to be found inside an office building.Built in 1967 by Kevin Roche and John Dinkeloo, the building was designed as the home of the Ford Foundation, Henry and Edsel Ford’s humanitarian charity organization. Twelve stories high and constructed of glass and steel, the building is an oversize tropical greenhouse. In the bizarre garden lush giant trees dwarf shrubs, magnolias, and garden terraces which slope down to verdant water pools. Stretching up to the roof on two sides, the open-plan offices of the Ford Foundation enable workers to look out across the tropical forest into each other’s offices. The two giant glass walls and ceiling act as a large-scale greenhouse, creating the tropical conditions for the plant life to thrive year round. Even real rainfall is collected on the roof and is added to the steam condensation from inside to water the plants and fill the water pools.One of the most remarkable buildings in the city, this unexpected tropical oasis just a wall away from the bustle of 43rd Street is open to the public all year long.  Update January 2018: As of 2017 the building was under renovation and closed the public until the fall of 2018.Sign up for our newsletter and get the best of Atlas Obscura in your inbox.",

          "description": "In 2006, a group of inspectors from the New York City Department of Transportation were on their usual rounds of bridge and tunnel inspections. The rounds were usual except for one discovery: Somewhere deep in the Manhattan anchorage of the Brooklyn Bridge they stumbled into a hidden room filled with blankets, water, a shock-prevention drug called dextran, and 350,000 crackers.Judging from the dates stamped on the supplies (1957 and 1962), what they discovered seemed to be a Cold War-era bunker or fallout shelter. Emergency survival shelters weren’t unusual back then – you can still see thousands of old “Fallout Shelter” signs and logos on buildings throughout the city. But one inside the Brooklyn Bridge? That no one knew about? That’s a different story.The inventory of the bunker’s cache followed a typical shopping list for emergency preparedness during the arms race of the 1950s and 60s: barrels of potable water (which the labels say can double as commodes when empty, so there’s that), first aid supplies and blankets, boxes of high-calorie survival crackers (yum), and a healthy supply of the drug dextran, which is used to prevent and treat shock (probably a good idea if you’re stranded inside a Brooklyn Bridge bunker).The supplies were marked as coming from the Office of Civil Defense, the Cold War precursor to what eventually became FEMA. Since the DOT had no idea the stash was there – or why it would be there – explanations are really only guesses. And, as with all the rooms and tunnels inside the anchorages of the Bridge, the public isn’t allowed inside. So the question of where, exactly, in the Manhattan-side anchorage they found the room, the DOT is keeping that under wraps for security reasons.They found one other stockpile alongside the survival supplies – a bunch of Mad Men-looking New York City promotional posters. The bunker may have been closed to the public, but not to a little old fashioned public relations.While you can't go in the old shelter, you can see the part of the Brooklyn Bridge where they found it - in what's called the anchorage (that's the base of a suspension bridge where the cables attach) on the Manhattan side, at the corner of Pearl Street and Dover Street.Sign up for our newsletter and get the best of Atlas Obscura in your inbox.",

          "description": "Built in 1872 and known then as the Blackwell Island Lighthouse, the fifty-foot-tall stone lighthouse at the northern tip of Roosevelt Island was built, if the legends can be believed, by the deranged occupants of a nearby insane asylum. But what’s not in doubt is that it was built by the city as a navigation aid for boats avoiding the rocks in the so-called “Hell Gate” waters.The legends of its origin are recounted on a sign that was once posted at the lighthouse:“The legendary mysteries are the names of Asylum inmate(s?) John McCarthy and Thomas Maxey and whether these two names refer to one person, two people, or even existent people. Supposedly, before the lighthouse was built, McCarthy (or Maxey), fearing a British invasion, was constructing a four-foot-high clay fort on this site. Asylum officials let him finish the fort because, during his adrenaline-rushed work, he reclaimed significant areas of marsh. (They even gave him old Civil War cannons as encouragement.) When the city wanted to build the Lighthouse, officials bribed or persuaded McCarthy either to give up or to demolish the fort.Whether McCarthy complied or not is the choice of the storyteller, but the fort did come down. Then, supposedly, another asylum patient was summoned to build the lighthouse. This inmate styled himself ‘Thomas Maxey, Esq., architect, mason, carpenter, civil engineer, philosopher, and philanthropist.’ The lighthouse was built, though adherence to Renwick’s blueprint is questionable. Despite Thomas Maxey’s supposed labor, John McCarthy’s name was credited on a plaque that remained at the Lighthouse’s base until its mysterious disappearance in the 1960s:‘This work was done by John McCarthy who built the lighthouse from the bottom to the top all ye who do pass by may pray for his soul when he dies.’”The lighthouse was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972 and made a New York City Landmark in 1976.Sign up for our newsletter and get the best of Atlas Obscura in your inbox.",

          "description": "Each day, thousands of subway riders at the 14th Street/8th Avenue station walk hurriedly by the tiny bronze figures that adorn the platforms. As they continue on with quickening footsteps, many miss out on one of the true gems of public art in New York City, Life Underground. But the playful statues belie the artist’s past as a controversial and violent performance artist.Designed by artist Tom Otterness, the miniature cartoon-like statues depict the real and imagined details of life and history in hectic New York City. In the most notable, a sewer alligator chomps on the behind of a money bag-headed miniature while another well-dressed man, perhaps based loosely on 19th century political machine leader Boss Tweed, looks on.Cute and playful with political undertones, each of the more than 100 bronze statues represent the tiny details, history, and myths of New York City, a place so chaotic that many of its residents miss out on the little things such as these. Constructed as part of a multi-million dollar subway renovation project in 2001, the clever bronze works have been widely overshadowed by Tom Otterness’ past work, a film entitled “Shot Dog Film,” in which Otterness shoots and kills a dog.Filmed in 1977,  Otterness has publicaly apologized for the violent, looped film, saying “Thirty years ago when I was 25 years old, I made a film in which I shot a dog. It was an indefensible act that I am deeply sorry for. Many of us have experienced profound emotional turmoil and despair. Few have made the mistake I made. I hope people can find it in their hearts to forgive me.” Despite the years and the apology some have called for Otterness’ funding to be pulled.Take any A, C or E train to the 14th St station. Also the L train to the 8th Avenue station and follow signs to the A, C, E platform.Some of the statues are on the upper level, most are on train platforms, many under stairwells.

          "description": "The house at 29 East 4th Street was home to the Tredwell family and their servants for nearly 100 years. Now, over 75 years since the last of the Tredwells vacated, the house remains virtually unchanged, a veritable time capsule of 19th century life and a National Historic Landmark.In 1835, Seabury Tredwell, his wife Eliza, and their six children moved to Manhattan’s aristocratic Bond Street neighborhood. The family resided there until 1933 when Gertrude Tredwell, the Tredwells’ youngest daughter, died in the house at the age of 93. In 1936 the house was opened to the public, serving as a near-perfect preservation of the styles and architecture of its time and offering an intimate glimpse of family life among the wealthy merchant class. The museum contains a large number of the family’s possessions, ranging from examples of 19th century decor and fashion to more personal, mundane items such as bedsheets, chamber pots, and sickbeds. The stunning family garden and recently restored servants’ quarters are also open to the public.The museum attracts more than just history buffs; reports of paranormal activity at the house date back to the 1930s, shortly after Gertrude Tredwell’s death. Over the decades, accounts of unexplained phenomena, including temperature fluctuations, strange smells, disembodied voices and footsteps, sounds of parties and piano-playing heard from the street, and alleged ghost sightings have earned the house the title of Most Haunted House in Manhattan. The most frequent report is of a woman in a brown dress moving about inside the house; she has even been rumored to interact with museum visitors. Generally observed as a benign presence, the woman is believed by paranormal enthusiasts to be the ghost of Gertrude Tredwell.Visitors are invited to tour the Merchant’s House Museum Thursday through Monday with guided tours offered at select times. Guests who opt for a self-guided tour are provided with a large, exhaustive binder containing information about the house and its collections. Though the museum does acknowledge its paranormal significance, selling a collection of Merchant’s House ghost stories in the gift shop and offering annual Candlelight Ghost Tours in October, the museum’s main focus remains on the Tredwells and their place in 19th century society.Around Halloween, the Merchant’s House holds a traditional 19th century funeral and decorates the whole place in Victorian mourning decor. The “funeral” has a coffin procession to the nearby New York City Marble Cemetery.Guided tours give you an in-depth look at the Tredwell family and the historical time period, and are available at no additional cost once you've paid to enter the museum. Tours are offered Thursdays at 2 pm and 6:30 pm and Friday-Monday at 2 pm. Access the Museum by taking the \"6\" subway train to Astor Place and then walking south for a few minutes along Lafayette Street past the Public Theater. Turn left onto East 4th Street and the museum is #29 on the left-hand side.Sign up for our newsletter and get the best of Atlas Obscura in your inbox.",

          "description": "Little green men stand ready to invade the west shore of Roosevelt Island in New York City. Well, not men so much as a coin and a house. And not invade so much as symbolize the struggle of wealth inequality in the city.The artistic commentary is appropriately called “The Marriage of Money and Real Estate.” It consists of three bronze sculptures: one of a coin being attacked by what seems to be an anthropomorphized moneybag coming out of the mouth of a man in a top hat, one of a house in a skirt being attacked by a lobster with a dollar sign on its face, and one of the house and coin joined in a happy marriage.The piece was created by Brooklyn-based artist Tom Otterness, who specializes in public art, and tends to feature such adorable figures in his sculptural work (you can see many more of his little bronze sculptures scattered all around the 14th Street/8th Avenue subway station). The figures poke up out of the East River near Roosevelt Island’s Octagon Field, just south of the ship-like performance stage known as “The Prow,” across the river from Manhattan’s John Jay Park between East 76th and East 78th streets. Depending on the tide, the figures attacking the main characters may or may not be visible above the water.Take the Queens-bound F train or the Roosevelt Island Tram from Manhattan, or the Roosevelt Island Bridge from Queens, and head north on the west side of the island. There are a lot of other great things to see while on the island, including the lighthouse at the northern tip and the smallpox hospital ruins toward the south, near the FDR Four Freedoms Park.Sign up for our newsletter and get the best of Atlas Obscura in your inbox.",

          "description": "A plaque posted on Pier 1 Imports at 3rd Avenue and 66th Street in Manhattan claims that Nathan Hale, a young American spy and soldier in the Revolutionary War, was strung up on a gallows within 100 yards of this site on September 22, 1776, and hanged by the British.This information comes from a British Officer’s diary, which stated that the hanging occurred at “the Royal Artillery Park near the Dove Tavern at the old Post Road,” which is now 3rd Avenue.Hale, born in Coventry, Connecticut, on June 6, 1755, and a teacher by trade, joined his five brothers in the fight for independence against the British. He quickly rose to the rank of captain in the military. He fought under General George Washington in New York, as British General William Howe began a military build-up on Long Island. Washington took his army onto Manhattan Island. At the battle of Harlem Heights, Washington, facing Howe in battle yet again, asked for a volunteer to go on a spy mission behind enemy lines. Hale stepped forward.Disguised as a Dutch schoolmaster, Hale set out on his mission. For a week he gathered information on the position of British troops, but was captured while returning to the American side. Because of incriminating papers Hale possessed, the British knew he was a spy. It is said that his cousin, a British sympathizer under Howe’s command, betrayed him. Howe ordered the 21-year-old Hale to be hanged the following day.Hale has gone down in history not just for his heroic fighting and intelligence-gathering, but because of the awesomely patriotic words he is said to have uttered just before his execution: “I only regret that I have but one life to lose for my country.” Perhaps this fame is why there are actually competing locations for where the hanging took place. Another plaque claiming to be the location of Hale’s execution is affixed to the building of the Yale Club (Hale was a Yale graduate, class of 1773) at East 44th Street and Vanderbilt Avenue. That plaque also claims that the “British Artillery Park” existed there. A 13-foot-statue of Nathan Hale also stands tall in City Hall Park.Sign up for our newsletter and get the best of Atlas Obscura in your inbox.",

But we have to give them a little credit since they have yet to find the Sidewalk Subway map in SoHo.Call it the ultimate distraction, or the local’s nightmare, but if tourists get a hold of this map carved into the sidewalk on Greene Street, we’re all in trouble. Human traffic will mercilessly pile up, and if things really go sour, people will start plotting their itineraries right there on the sidewalk.

          "description": "While waiting on the F train platform on a Sunday in the month between Thanksgiving and Christmas, you might think you’ve stepped into the Twilight Zone when eight vintage subway cars barrel up to your station. This is the holiday train, a once-a-year treat courtesy of the MTA’s New York Transit Museum, which whisks MTA patrons back in time. The “Shoppers Special,” comprised of cars from the 1930s to the 1970s, is bedecked with wreaths and bows for the season. People are charmed by both the similarities and differences between modern subway cars and those of yesteryear. Seats were upholstered with rattan, stops were announced by analog rolling signs, and the heavy doors would squish you if you didn’t get out of the way. There was no air conditioning, of course, so ventilation was provided by ceiling fans and open slats above the windows (which would have made the ride much noisier). Even the ads are vintage—in one a flapper encourages you to chew Wrigley’s spearmint after every meal, and another advertises a Central Park “Citizenship Day” celebration hosted by Mayor Robert F. Wagner.The arrival of the holiday train is quite an event; so much so that some people dress up in period fashion just for the occasion. The immersive atmosphere is enough to make you believe the train could be shuttling you back to 1940, at least for the few minutes you have no cell service underground.Outside the holiday season the vintage cars are on view at the Transit Museum. Visitors can walk through the museum’s “nostalgia fleet” and appreciate all the historic transportation features–minus the rattle and rumble of the tracks.For a schedule of when to catch the nostalgia train, visit the NY Transit Museum’s website.Sign up for our newsletter and get the best of Atlas Obscura in your inbox.",

          "description": "In a bar in Manhattan that is covered in art, lives the last public place Ludwig Bemelmans’ whimsy plays a big part.The story of the feisty literary heroine Madeline begins in Paris, but the girl with the red hair and big yellow hat travels all around the world in the books written and illustrated by Ludwig Bemelmans. Much like his most famous character, Bemelmans’ life began in Europe, in the Austrian Tirol, but he emigrated to the United States when he was nearly 20 years old. After working in the hotel industry and serving in the army, he began writing and illustrating books for children. He found huge success with his Madeline series, the first book of which came out in 1939.He went on to write five books about the spunky seven-year-old and her adventures, and also produced popular artwork for publications like The New Yorker and Vogue. In the 1940s, Bemelmans took on a commission that combined two of his passions: hotels and painting. He was contracted to decorate the new bar that was built in The Carlyle, a luxury hotel in Manhattan’s Upper East Side.For this, he was paid not in cash, but received free board for himself and his family for a year and a half, the duration it took for the wall murals to be completed.The dull yellow of the walls is enlivened by elephants, rabbits, and other animals frolicking around Central Park, all painted in Bemelmans’ trademark style. Madeline and her friends can also be spotted, alongside other typical park scenes like dogs sprinting with their owners and nurses taking babies for a stroll. The simplicity of the wall art is contrasted by the more luxurious Art Deco interiors of the bar. The ceilings are coated in gold leaf and leather banquettes line the walls, placed near glass-top tables. The whimsical artwork adds to the New York City piano bar’s quiet appeal and it is the only remaining place where Bemelmans’ work that is open to the public. It’s all there is, and there isn’t anymore.It is located in the Carlyle Hotel. Sign up for our newsletter and get the best of Atlas Obscura in your inbox.",

Until you reach number 18 that is.In a row of red brick townhouses, Lynch’s former home juts out at a disconcerting and awkward right angle to the street. The oddly shaped building tells the story of one of New York’s most interesting and unknown events when around lunchtime on Friday, March 6th, 1970, the house disappeared in a violent bomb blast. A cell of radical left wing students had been preparing pipe bombs in the basement, when their inexperience with dynamite destroyed the building in what became known as the Weathermen Townhouse Explosion.The Weathermen were members of the radical Weather Underground group. Named after a lyric in Bob Dylan’s Subterranean Homesick Blues (“You don’t need a weatherman to know which way the wind blows”), the protest group was founded at the University of Michigan in the late 1960s. A militant faction of the Students for Democratic Society, the “Weathermen,” as they called themselves, protested the Vietnam war by bombing the US Capitol, the Pentagon, and organizing the “Days of Rage” protest in Chicago in 1969.On the ill-fated day of March 6th, two of the Weathermen were working on making pipe bombs in the basement of Number 18. Diana Oughton, a 28-year old community college teacher, and Terry Robbins, a 23-year old left wing activist who had been part of the Kent State campus riots in 1968, were making the bombs using dynamite and and nails as shrapnel. Their plan was supposedly to bomb an officer’s party at Fort Dix in New Jersey, and the library of Columbia University. Unfortunately Robbins’ inexperience with explosives caused him to cross wires and the resulting explosion completely demolished the townhouse in an instant. A third member of the cell, Ted Gold, was walking into the house when it exploded, and he was killed by collapsing masonry. Upstairs the two remaining members of the group, Kathy Boudin and Cathy Wilkerson, stumbled onto the street, covered in blood, their clothes burnt off their bodies. The story goes that their neighbor at Number 16, a certain Dustin Hoffman, came out to help them. Finding a loose subway token in the rubble, Boudin and Wilkerson ran for Sixth Avenue and boarded an uptown F train, evading capture. A police search of the rubble yielded a live anti-tank artillery shell, 57 sticks of dynamite, four pipe bombs and a map of the network of tunnels underneath Columbia University. But of Boudin and Wilkerson, no trace was to be seen.  For nearly a decade they evaded capture, despite being on the FBI’s most wanted list. Wilkerson finally surrendered in 1980, and Boudin was arrested taking part in the 1981 Brink’s armored car robbery that resulted in the killing of two policemen and an armed guard.The house at Number 18 was reconstructed in 1978 by modernist architect Hugh Hardy into the weirdly askew angular home it is today. It is currently for sale as though it were any other luxury home on the block. The only reminder of the terrible explosion that took the lives of three radicals in the home is the extraordinarily angled facade in the middle of it, a peculiar monument to one of New York’s most bizarre and unknown stories.Sign up for our newsletter and get the best of Atlas Obscura in your inbox.",

          "description": "Marooned on a triangular intersection at the heart of New York City’s busiest neighborhood sits One Times Square, the iconic setting for the annual New Year’s Eve ball dropping ceremony, broadcasted worldwide and attracting hundreds of thousands of revelers each December 31.Oddly in one of the most expensive and photographed locations in the world, One Times Square is nearly completely empty. Walgreens occupies the first floor, and leases everything up through the 21st floor, but they have chosen to leave the building vacant as the advertising on the sides is worth more, and is less trouble than having tenants. The building does have one other tenant however, and that is Jeff Straus who runs the New Year’s Eve celebration from his 22nd floor office. Above him is the New Year’s ball itself located on a metal roof deck. But it wasn’t always this way. Constructed in 1904 as the headquarters for the New York Times, it was the tallest building in the city when measured from basement level to roof deck. One Times Square’s completion coincided with the opening of the city’s first subway line in 1904 and was instrumental in the development of its surroundings into a thriving commercial area.  In a brilliant publicity ploy, the paper’s owner Adolph Ochs volunteered to hold the city’s New Year’s Eve celebration for the building’s opening year. The festivities had previously been held at lower Manhattan’s Trinity Church, but the raucous nature of the night was nerve-wracking for Trinity and the church was relieved to relinquish their role in the celebration. Ochs was intent on making December 31, 1904, a night to remember and spared no expense. An all-day festival in the streets culminated at midnight with fireworks raining down on over 200,000 guests and One Times Square was officially marked as the new setting for the city’s annual New Year’s Eve bash.Within a couple of years the fireworks display was banned by the city because of the dangers of explosives showering debris down on attendees.  Ochs was determined not to let the ban detract from the spectacular quality of the city’s New Year’s festivities and turned to the newspaper’s chief electrician, Walter F. Palmer,  to create an alternatively showy way to celebrate the arrival of 1908.  Inspired by the downtown Western Union Telegraph building’s clock tower, which dropped an iron ball at noon each day, Palmer hired a young Russian immigrant, Jacob Starr, to create a 700-pound ball made of iron and wood.  The Times Square Ball was made that year, illuminated with one hundred 25-watt lightbulbs and ceremoniously lowered at midnight.  The event was a massive success, and for most of the remainder of the 20th century, Starr, and later the sign-making company he founded, Artkraft Strauss, continued to be responsible for the yearly ball dropping ceremony as well as much of the design of the massive, luminous signage that has become indelibly associated with Times Square.The Times Square Ball has since been redesigned and upgraded several times across the decades.  The ball’s current incarnation weighs in at 11,875 pounds and is 12 feet in diameter. The sphere is composed of 2,688 individual Waterford Crystal triangles, impressively illuminated by tens of thousands of Philips LEDs.  It shimmers year-round from the roof deck of One Times Square, a glowing beacon overlooking the hustle and bustle of Manhattan.  Hovering high above the city streets, the Times Square Ball patiently awaits December 31, when millions of spectators around the world will gather once again to breathlessly count down the symbolic sphere’s glittery descent and the coming of a new year.Sign up for our newsletter and get the best of Atlas Obscura in your inbox.",

          "description": "Named for the former New York Governor Dewitt Clinton, Clinton Cove is a spectacular park in New York, New York. It includes a big green lawn for picnicking, a boathouse holdings canoes and kayaks and more, and more, including a giant bottle known as Private Passage. Created by artist Malcolm Cochran, Private Passage is a distinctive sculpture measuring 30 feet long.A wine bottle resting on its side built using a combination of bronze and zinc with a traditional green patina, Private Passage is perhaps best known for the intricate representation of an interior stateroom from the Queen Mary ocean liner that sits inside of it. The interior was built using sheet metal and other materials that would give it a monochromatic look, representing black and white film from a 1930s magazine advertisement.Visitors to Private Passage in Clinton Cove can see the interior through a number of portholes along the sides of the bottle. There are larger windows at either extreme end of the bottle; they give visitors a view straight through the middle. During the day, a row of portholes along the top of the bottle functions as a series of skylights. At night or when clouds block the sunlight, the stateroom inside of Private Passage is illuminated by electric lights that are made to look as though they are part of the cabin’s furnishings.The sculpture was created with the New York City Percent for Art program, administered through the Department of Cultural Affairs.Located at 56th street and Hudson River Greenway.Sign up for our newsletter and get the best of Atlas Obscura in your inbox.",

          "description": "Fraunces Tavern was originally the home of early New York mayor Stephanus van Cortlandt, but the building quickly became a clubhouse for revolutionaries, eventually hosting George Washington when he bid farewell to his officers at the end of the Revolutionary War. Today Fraunces Tavern is mainly known as a bar serving tourists and Wall Streets workers, but when the site was purchased by Samuel Fraunces in 1762, and he opened his Queen’s Head Tavern, its patrons were almost exclusively revolutionaries plotting against British forces.A number of groups such as the famous Sons of Liberty, who were eventually responsible for the Boston Tea Party, met at the site to plan their intrigues. However the event that would forever mark the tavern as a place of note was the “turtle feast” held by George Washington himself at the end of the war wherein he bid farewell to his officers with a rousing toast and a personal conference with each.After the war, the pub and the building attached to it became home to a number of early American governmental congresses for a time when New York was made the official capitol of the country. It remained protected as a historic building, but eventually became less talked about in subsequent years.The site was later brought back into the spotlight during the 1970’s when a bomb placed by FALN, the Armed Forces of Puerto Rican National Liberation, a group devoted to seeing their home removed from U.S. control, exploded in the doorway of the bar. A number of people were killed and countless others wounded, but the ale house lived on.Reconstructed as Fraunces Tavern, the bar is now a popular tourist site and after-work spot for Wall Streeters. There is now a museum attached to the bar, remembering its revolutionary history and a plaque remembering the victims of the 1970s bombing.   Sign up for our newsletter and get the best of Atlas Obscura in your inbox.",

There is no telling what kind of experience you will have, but an open mind will certainly take you further in the New York New Church. An institution based on the teachings of Christian mystic, Emmanuel Swedenborg, the possibility of a supernatural experience is enough to pull many visitors to each ceremony.Of course, this is not without reason. Swedenborg, along with being a Christian reformer, was well-known for his mid 18th-century psychic visions. One of these visions even correctly predicted a fire in Stockholm, that spared Swedenborg’s house. Coincidence or crazy, entering the church and participating in a seance may be the only way to find out.Accessible from B,D,F,M,N,Q,R Trains at 34th Street Herald Square StationSign up for our newsletter and get the best of Atlas Obscura in your inbox.",

          "name": "The Site of Stanford White's Sex Crimes",
          "description": "Walking westward along 24th Street in Manhattan, halfway down between 5th and 6th Avenues, there is a small gap between the buildings.Currently a parking lot, the address Number “22” once belonged to a building that no longer exists, collapsed in 2007 after years of neglect. On Number 24 next door, imprints of Number 22 can still be seen etched into the brick walls; marks where a flight of stairs would have been, the remnants of the floors, and the slant of the roof. This ghostly impression is all that remains of New York’s greatest architect and spoiler of women, the seducing chambers of Stanford White.By the turn of the 20th century, Stanford White was a leading light in New York society. As the pre-eminent member of legendary Manhattan architecture firm McKim, Mead & White, he transformed New York from grimy brownstones and the slums of the Bowery into the glittering Beaux Arts city we know today. His masterpieces include the Washington Memorial Arch in the Village, the original Pennsylvania Station, the Players Club and the 5th Avenue mansions for the Astor and the Vanderbilt families. Stanford lived principally in the original Madison Square Garden, on what is now Madison Square Park, his home a tower topped with a gold naked statue of Diana—but across the park in the dingy side streets of West 24th St, the Pharaoh of Fifth Avenue kept his concealed love lair. By the time she was 16, Evelyn Nesbit was the most photographed and famous woman of her era. The original Gibson girl, she was spotted on stage by White, who showered her with lavish gifts until she consented to come to lunch on West 24th St. With nothing much to look at from the outside except for a shop window for the original FAO Schwarz on street level, the inside was a different world.Regarding her first visit to White’s abode, Evelyn described “the sudden plunge from the dingy street entrance into this room was breathtaking. The predominating color was a wonderful red…heavy red velvet curtains shut out all the daylight.” Decorated in luxurious red Oriental silks and up-lit works of art, this room was where White dined his girls with feasts brought in from Delmonico’s. After lunch, Evelyn was invited to follow White upstairs, walking up a murky staircase to where she was ushered into a room of deep forest green. Hanging from the ceiling was a “gorgeous swing with red velvet ropes around which trailed green similax, set high in the ceiling.”In his favorite hideaway, White introduced Evelyn to the pleasures of the red velvet swing, eventually taking her to his bedroom covered in mirrors, where he drugged and raped her. But Evelyn was so taken by the dashing and debaucherous White, they continued to rendezvous at the four-story building at 22 West 24th St. consensually for years. The legendarily dastardly hedonist would pay for his crimes in 1906, when Evelyn’s then husband Harry K. Thaw gunned White down during a performance in the rooftop theatre of the old Madison Square Garden. The case became known as the “crime of the century” and the media was filled with salacious details of the murder, yet the small, innocuous looking building on West 24th Street was forgotten. It became a low rent hotel, and eventually collapsed in 2007. What happened to the red velvet swing no one knows, or at least no one who’s telling.Sign up for our newsletter and get the best of Atlas Obscura in your inbox.",

          "description": "While it’s not smallest piece of park property in New York, Septuagesimo Uno is still a charmingly diminutive plot of land, occupying a mere 0.04 acres between two townhouses on West 71st Street. The creation of the park may date to Mayor John Lindsay’s era, but its roots lie in the Commissioners Plan of 1811, which laid out the Manhattan grid system of roads with 12 avenues and 155 cross-streets. Parks were included in the plan at 53rd, 66th, 77th and 120th Streets. But, while the plan was effective at predicting and handling the explosive growth the city would experience over the next 150 years, it ultimately failed to provide enough parkland for recreation. To help alleviate demand, Mayor Lindsay started up the Vest Pocket Park campaign, which squeezed public space in wherever it could. The lot on 71st Street was condemned in 1969, landscaped by the city and eventually handed over to the stewardship of the NYC Parks Department in 1981. As for its name? It’s Latin for “seventy-one,” and was appended by parks commissioner Henry J. Stern in 2000 after a $14,325 renovation. Its original name was the much blander “71st Street Plot.”Septuagesimo Uno is located on the south side of 71st street between West End and Amsterdam Avenues; the closest subway is the 1/2/3 a block away on Broadway. The park closes at dusk.Sign up for our newsletter and get the best of Atlas Obscura in your inbox.",

          "description": "The main branch of the New York public library is home to many secrets, from it’s pneumatic delivery tubes to the 40 miles of shelves of underground storage hiding underneath neighboring Bryant Park. But the Manhattan icon, built in 1911 on the site of a former potter’s field and reservoir, holds a thrilling secret in one of its second floor study rooms. In July 1987, Earl Edwin Pitts walked up the grand steps of the public library, past the noble lion statues (Patience and Fortitude, respectively). Strolling past the security guard at the revolving doors, and across the imposing marble hallway, he climbed the steps past the Astor memorial to room 228, The Wertheim Study. It was in this room, named after Maurice Wertheim, publisher of “The Nation,” that Pitts had a fateful meeting that would begin a decade long career of espionage. What whispered words passed between the two men in that study we will never know, but then again, secrets were their stock in trade; for Pitts was an FBI agent, and the man he met, surrounded by law books, was Aleksandr Vasilyevich Karpov, an agent for the Komitet gosudarstvennoy bezopasnosti, better known as the KGB. For the next five years, Pitts regularly met Karpov and handed over sensitive and highly classified secrets to his Soviet handler in exchange for nearly a quarter of a million dollars. Pitts had joined the FBI in 1983, and by 1987 was working in its New York bureau when he began his secret career as a Soviet spy. Amongst the high level intelligence Pitts handed over to Karpov over the next five years were reports on “recruitment operations involving Russian intelligence officers, double agent operations, operations targeting Russian intelligence officers, true identities of human assets, operations against Russian illegals, true identities of defector sources, surveillance schedules of known meet sites, internal policies, documents, and procedure concerning surveillance of Russian intelligence officers, and the identification, targeting and reporting on known and suspected KGB intelligence officers in the New York area.”Pitts’ treason was eventually discovered in 1996 when Karpov defected to the United States, and named Pitts as a KGB operative. The FBI launched a 16-month long false flag operation during which Pitts was approached by undercover federal agents posing as fellow Russian spies. Once he was apprehended, Earl Edwin Pitts was convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage, and was sentenced to 27 years imprisonment at the Federal Correctional Institution in Ashland, Kentucky, where he remains to this day. In exchange for his cooperation, Karpov was given a new identity after he defected, and his current location is unknown.Quite how much damage Pitts did is lost in the murky underworld of the Cold War. But affidavits of United States vs Earl Edwin Pitts are in the public record, and make fascinating reading. During his trial, the only explanation Pitts gave was to “pay the FBI back.” So the next time you are on the corner of 5th Avenue and 42nd street, pay a visit to one of Manhattan’s most venerable institutions and take a moment to remember that you are walking in the footsteps of Cold War agents, stolen secrets, and treacherous espionage. Sign up for our newsletter and get the best of Atlas Obscura in your inbox.",

          "description": "If you were standing on the northwest corner of Washington Place and Greene Street on March 25, just over a century ago, at 4:45 p.m., you would have looked up to see women, mostly, engulfed in flames and hurling themselves from the top floors of a building.In 1911, Triangle Shirtwaist Company, which made a style of popular women’s blouse, caught fire. The employees had little chance of escaping the flames. The stairwells were locked, the fire escape buckled, and the elevator had a carrying capacity of 15. A total of 146 of the company’s 500 employees, most of them Jewish women, died either from the flames, the smoke, or from fatal injuries endured after hitting the ground while jumping to escape.This single incident is responsible for most of the first worker and fire safety standards put in place in the United States government. The fire was the city’s deadliest workplace incident until the September 11 terrorist attacks.It's accessible from N and R trains at 8th Street Station. The building is currently part of NYU and houses the chemistry labs. There is a plaque on the building and a commemoration ceremony held annually on the infamous date.Sign up for our newsletter and get the best of Atlas Obscura in your inbox.",

          "description": "This is, without a doubt, the world’s worst bar to get sloppy drunk with a coworker.Along the East River sits an impeccably designed, football-field-sized room that, depending on the date and time of day, positively teems with the world’s post influential people. To the initiated, they think very little of it; merrily drinking and carousing, they’re simply shaking off a work week. To the rest of us, this is the most jaw-dropping social hour on the planet, for the scene described is taking place within United Nation’s Delegates Lounge, during one of their infamous monthly jazz concerts.By day, the Lounge is used as a mellow spot in which coffee and negotiations take place. Redecorated by Rem Koolhaas (at the behest of Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands) over the course of five years, the Lounge itself is every bit as slick as one would imagine for a $1.9 million dollar price tag. An 11th-century Surya Sun God (a gift from Indira Gandhi in 1982) is among the room’s heritage decorations predating the 2013 renovation, as was once the Nobel Peace Prize awarded jointly to Kofi Annan and the United Nations as a whole. At night, however, things loosen up a bit as the bars are rolled out from behind closed doors. The spot is, understandably, a favorite among the staffers and delegates. It’s loyalists have even gone so far as to refer to it as the “Seventh Committee,” in tribute to the U.N.’s six official working committees. According to one officer with the Department of Peacekeeping Operations, “Some days, when it’s your job to help achieve the mandate of peace on earth, it’s a requirement to come down, look at the art and relax.”Best yet, if you play your cards right, a spot on the guest list to the world’s most peaceful international jazz night could yet land in your lap. Though stricter than recent years (due repeated breaking of guest rules, poorly behaved interns, and everyone getting too busy on the dance floor) the process of gaining admission to the Delegates Lounge now stands at two guests per staffer, no interns without a Secretariat ID, and no DJs on Friday nights unless someone is hosting an official party.Sign up for our newsletter and get the best of Atlas Obscura in your inbox.",

          "description": "Dwarfed by the surrounding skyscrapers of the Financial District lies a small church, a still functioning chapel that has been faithfully ministering to its parishioners for nearly 250 years. It is so old, that it dates from a time when its founders were instructed to establish the chapel by John Wesley himself. Organized in 1766 the church on Manhattan’s John Street is America’s oldest and first Methodist chapel. Rightly known as the Mother Church of American Methodism, the church held its first meeting on October 12th, 1766.Barbara Heck was a German Lutheran living as a refugee in Ireland where she was converted to Methodism by Wesley himself. Emigrating to New York with her cousin Philip Embury, she was horrified one day to walk into her kitchen and find her cousins playing cards. She beseeched Embury, “Philip, you must preach to us or we will all go to hell together.” The cousins rented out the loft space of a ship’s rigging outfitters at 120 William Street as their first meeting house. Soon outgrowing the cramped quarters they built the first Methodist chapel in America in 1768 around the corner on John Street, where it still stands today. During the Revolutionary War, British soldiers would harass the peace keeping Methodists, slashing the women’s dresses with their swords, and digging ditches outside the main entrance during services to trip the exiting Methodists. Once soldiers dressed as devils interrupted a service, storming the pulpit.Hidden away down one of the Financial District’s smallest streets, today the Methodist chapel carries about its work as it has down the past two and a half centuries. The chapel is small, but beautifully maintained and well appointed. Underneath the chapel are recreation rooms used for smaller meetings and Sunday schools. It also houses a quite remarkable museum. The collection includes a still working clock given to Embury and Heck by John Wesley himself in 1768. There is also the original lecturn handmade by Embury and used to preach from in the old rigging loft. Central to Methodism was the idea that close personal fellowship could only be attained by meeting in small groups. Called Class Meetings, the church-goers would sit in a close knit circle; one of their original distinctive circular set of chairs dating from the 18th century is here as well.A quite remarkable find, and one hardly known about or visited, the John Street church still prides itself not just on its long and illustrious history, but on preaching Methodism to its surrounding community today just as it did nearly 250 years ago. The museum is open Monday, Wednesday, and Friday (except holidays) from noon to 5 p.m. Sign up for our newsletter and get the best of Atlas Obscura in your inbox.",

          "description": "Little known to most commuters there have been posh, exclusive tennis courts hidden on the upper levels of Grand Central Terminal since the 1960’s, but the Vanderbilt Tennis Club is the current purveyor of courts behind the famous vaulted windows. A fitness center has existed in Grand Central Terminal since the 1960’s, originally in the form of the Vanderbilt Athletic Club, which featured two clay tennis courts (and oddly, a 65-foot indoor ski slope). However by the 80’s this club had fallen into disrepair. In 1984, thanks to a number of sweetheart real estate deals, none other than Donald Trump leased the space and opened a new tennis and fitness club. Trump renovated the aged space, turning its third floor annex into an uber-exclusive court for the rich and famous, hosting movie stars and celebrities willing to pay in cash (no credit cards accepted). The now spotless clay courts operated in semi-secrecy for 30 years until Trump’s lease, having been month-to-month for the final decade of its existence was finally given over in 2009 to create, surprisingly not an even more exclusive space, but a full-service lounge and rest area for MTA workers. However, the dream of train station tennis was not yet dead. While Grand Central went without a tennis court for a couple of years, the Vanderbilt Tennis Club moved into the fourth floor of the station in 2011. This new location features a regulation-size tennis court, practice courts and other limited fitness services. While not as exclusive as Trump’s courts, the costs (around $100-$250 an hour) do seem geared towards a certain economic echelon.The main court is actually located behind the the top portion of the famous facade window, so next time you look at that famous architectural spot remember that you could get a few rounds in if you’ve got the money.  Sign up for our newsletter and get the best of Atlas Obscura in your inbox.",

          "description": "Now an anonymous condominium, it stands on a site of one of the financial building blocks of New York City, and one of it’s greatest shames: the slave trade. Originating with eleven West African captives brought to New Amsterdam in irons in 1626, the New York slave trade grew over the following hundred and fifty years to be one of the most essential cogs in the triangle trade. 75 Wall Street, on the lot bounded by Water and Pearl Streets, is the most widely accepted address of this auction block.The original eleven slaves were immediately tasked with constructing defenses for the small Dutch colony in the form of a wall across the town’s northern frontier. Years later, the wall would be taken down and its fragments used to level the roads and expand the island as landfill: all done by slaves.At the start of the 18th century, the corner of Wall and Pearl Street was an open-air market, where slaves were unloaded from ships in the nearby East River. The river at that time was much closer at Water Street, which would mean that the sale of slaves would occur right under the shadow of their floating prisons. Later improvement brought a sheltered complex, city oversight and, of course, tax revenue. Slaves were sold throughout the city and surrounding region. In a wider scope, New York positioned itself as the port city where agricultural goods grown by slaves in the South were financed, refined, packaged and shipped around the world. The New York Stock Exchange, just up the street, owes its startup capital to the slave economy.No evidence remains of the New York Slave Market. In June of 2015, the City of New York unveiled a small plaque in the beer garden adjacent to the modern day 75 Wall Street. The small plaque memorializing the many thousands of slaves who were abducted and sold on what is now 75 Wall St. is roughly the size of a plaque across the street at 74 Wall Street honoring the Livingston family, who owed their political prominence to the wealth they generated from the slave trade. The United States currently has no significant national memorial to slavery.75 Wall Street between Pine and Water Streets.Sign up for our newsletter and get the best of Atlas Obscura in your inbox.",

          "description": "Near the entrance of an office building in the middle of midtown, by a set of tables where business people sit down and eat their lunches every day, sits in the shadow of a literal slice of history.After the fall of the Berlin Wall, pieces were divided up and sold. Four of these pieces reside in New York City, one of the pieces stands in a garden near the UN building, a section sits at the entrance of the Intrepid Air and space museum, and one between the Gateway Plaza, the North Cove Marina, and the World Financial Center. There is a sort of symbolic significance with the section of the wall on Madison Avenue. The piece stands by itself by an office building, straight in the middle of the bustling midtown, not near any other significant landmarks like the other sections of the wall. This piece of the wall stands among the people as a daily part of life, much like how the wall was a part of daily life in Berlin all those years ago.So while you eat your lunch in the shadow of this Berlin wall, think about the sad rations of bland food that the people have to eat East Berlin, and revel in the fact that you’re here, in Midtown, celebrating capitalism next to the Berlin Wall.Update August, 2017: Still located at 520 Madison, the pieces have been moved inside due to damage occurring to them from a nearby water fountain. Update February  2018: The Three sections of the Berlin Wall have been removed from the building  at 520 Madison Avenue. It has been said they might be erected in Rockefeller Center sometime by mid-2018. Accessible from E,M Trains at 53rd Street Station.Sign up for our newsletter and get the best of Atlas Obscura in your inbox.",

          "description": "Amidst the bustle of New York City in the heart of Central Park is a celebration of a beloved children’s classic—Lewis Carroll’s Alice in Wonderland.The group of bronze statues was commissioned by local philanthropist George Delacorte in honor of his wife, Margarita, who used to read the book and Carroll’s other works to their children. They were designed by sculptor Jose de Creeft and brought to the life at the Modern Art Foundry in Queens. The heroine of the book Alice is seated atop a giant mushroom and the statue is thought to be a likeness of the designer’s daughter Donna. The book’s other characters like the White Rabbit, the Dormouse, and the Cheshire Cat are all placed around Alice. The statue of the Mad Hatter is supposed to be a caricature of George Delacorte himself. Since the monument was dedicated in May 1959, it has been a favorite of children visiting the park, who enjoy scrambling all over the statues, which were designed with this express purpose in mind. Margarita Delacorte’s favorite Lewis Carroll poem The Jabberwocky is engraved around the statue, along with other poetic bits from the book, all referencing nursery rhymes and childhood songs of the time.  The one engraved text modern audiences can most easily recognize is Twinkle Twinkle Little Bat—its source material still sung by kids today.The statue is located on East 74th Street, north of Conservatory Water.

          "description": "Although Governors Island off the coast of Manhattan has seen an off-and-on military presence since the Revolutionary War, one need not enlist to reach it any longer. In 1996 the Coast Guard – the last of the military tenants of the Island – finally folded up their charts, and while it took a few years and some (luckily) unfulfilled development plans, Governors Island is now open to the public from May to September, finally allowing access to historic Castle Williams.On the northwest corner of the island, Castle Williams was the jewel in the defensive crown set up on Governors Island to protect New York from attack during the War of 1812. The circular red sandstone defense was finished in 1811, a cousin to the better-known Castle Clinton at Battery Park just across the channel. The eight-foot-thick walls of the “castle” were arranged in a circular arch so that the 100 cannons installed within could fire in just about every direction.The defense was fearsome enough that it never even had to be tested. The British never attacked New York during the War of 1812. The fort remained and acted as a Union barracks and jail during the Civil War, before being converted to a full military prison later on. The castle operated as a prison of some sort until 1965, when the aging structure was finally decommissioned.Today Castle Williams is restored and protected as a historical landmark on Governors Island. During the summer months, the castle can be toured with the help of a guide who will walk visitors through the many lives of the historic fort.The ferry leaves 7 days a week from lower Manhattan (terminal next to the Staten Island Ferry), at South & Whitehall Streets. On weekends there is also a ferry from Pier 6 at Brooklyn Bridge Park, at the end of Atlantic Avenue.Sign up for our newsletter and get the best of Atlas Obscura in your inbox.",

          "description": "If you ever happen to find yourself running late for a Broadway show, but don’t know the address of the theatre, and for some reason can’t look it up on your phone, there’s no need to panic. Just walk to the middle of Times Square, to Duffy Square. There, between McDonalds and American Eagle, just north of the statue of George M. Cohan on 46th Street, you can find your theatre on the giant map embedded into the traffic island.The Spotlight on Broadway Map is 28 feet long and plots the locations of the 40 Broadway theaters that were in operation at the time the map was created in 2013. The map is made of gray granite and stainless steel (and one hopes it is alterable, not only because Broadway theaters have their names changed every so often, but because a 41st theater, the Hudson Theatre, is set to officially open in the winter of 2017).The blocky, stylized map is part of the larger Spotlight on Broadway project, which includes an interactive website with videos that tell stories about the theaters. The map was designed by Doyle Partners and Local Projects, partnering with a Norwegian architectural firm called SnØhetta, and was also part of a larger effort to rebuild public areas in the Times Square area.Because Broadway theaters tend to be named after theatrical luminaries, the map also serves as a beautiful memorial to some of the greatest talents ever to work on Broadway, including composer Richard Rodgers, composer/lyricist Stephen Sondheim, playwright August Wilson, actress and philanthropist Vivian Beaumont, and caricaturist Al Hirschfeld. For people who love to attend Broadway shows, the map not only tells where the theaters are, but gives a great impression of the shape of the Broadway theatre district, which may seem huge and sprawling from ground level but is actually quite densely packed. Most of the theaters are between Broadway  and 8th Avenue and 40th and 54th Streets, with some very noticeable outliers, like the Hirschfeld west of 8th and the Beaumont way up on 65th Street in Lincoln Center.Every subway train stops at 42nd Street, so any train on the orange, red, or blue lines will get you within easy walking distance of the map. It is near the TKTS booth in Duffy Square, so walking up Broadway or 7th Avenue to 46th Street is the best way to get there.

          "description": "In 1930s New York City, William Lescaze used the design for his own Modernist house, the first in the city, to demonstrate his ideas about function over style. In the process, he created a new architectural fashion in America.One of the pioneers of American Modernism, Lescaze believed the design of a house could influence the health and happiness of the resident, and that houses had to meet the needs of the people they were built for.In 1934, he took a pre-Civil War brownstone and overhauled it for his own purposes. He eliminated ornamentation with a flat, simple façade that had a curved, inset entryway.His most significant innovation was his use of glass blocks for the façade and for skylights, having seen them used in Europe. The skylights, embedded in the concrete back patio, allowed natural light into his ground floor office.The glass blocks that dominated the façade, alternating with gray stucco and ribbon windows, allowed tons of natural light into the simple, modern rooms of the residential floors without allowing passersby a clear, wide-open view of the residents’ private lives.The glass block windows also obscured the view of the building across the street, which Lescaze did not want to have to look at, and were thick enough that they did not let much street noise in or increase the energy bill (his house was also the first residence in the city to have central air conditioning). It did not take long for the use of glass block windows to spread, since they solved so many problems of city life.Sign up for our newsletter and get the best of Atlas Obscura in your inbox.",

          "description": "For a hundred years this elegant American elm at the center of Tompkins Square Park was just a tree. Then, in 1966, the Hare Krishna mantra was chanted under its sprawling canopy for the first time, and it became the birthplace of a religion.To Hare Krishnas, this tree is a sacred site. For everyone else, it would be easy to stroll by the old elm in Manhattan’s East Village and have no idea it’s a religious landmark. It’s a handsome tree — American elms are quite rare now, known for their wide-stretching canopies — but otherwise inconspicuous. But if you happened to wander by on October 9, 1966, you would have heard the “Hare Krishna” mantra chanted publicly for the first time outside of India, marking the birth of the spiritual movement in the West.At the base of the tree, Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada and a group of robed followers spent two hours chanting, dancing, playing tambourines and cymbals, and seeking Krishna — a pure and blissful consciousness. Among them was Beatnik poet Allen Ginsberg, who was living nearby. He later wrote, “The ecstasy of chant or mantra has replaced LSD and other drugs for many of the swami’s followers.”At the time, lower Manhattan was the epicenter of a bohemian counterculture, the Haight-Ashbury of the East Coast. Hippies flowed into Tompkins Square Park, which has long been both a neighborhood respite and a symbol of subversion, where activists staged anti-war protests and women marched for liberation. Not long after the Swami first sang Hare Krishna under the old elm tree, legends like Jimi Hendrix and the Grateful Dead played at the park’s new bandshell.If you venture a few blocks from the park you’ll find 26 Second Avenue, where Swami Prabhupada founded the International Society for Krishna Consciousness. He rented a storefront that would serve as both the religious movement’s headquarters and a Hare Krishna temple. Amazingly, the temple remains there today, next to a vintage boutique.Devotees still travel to Tompkins Square Park to visit the Hare Krishna Tree, where George Harrison once sought a higher consciousness, leaving garland and flowers around the holy elm’s wide trunk.Open to the public, about a 10-minute walk from various subway lines. The tree is the large elm at the south end of the Central Grove section, in just about the middle of the park. Sign up for our newsletter and get the best of Atlas Obscura in your inbox.",

          "description": "These days it’s hard to find much of the original heart of old Times Square, but hidden amidst the crowds of tourists and neon signs, around the corner of Broadway on West 46th street, is the venerable facade of Israel Miller’s shoe store, looking much as it did a hundred years ago.Miller’s passion was designing elegant shoes for elegant women, and his creations graced the feet of some of the most famed actresses of the day. In giant script along the side of his building, ran the tag line “The Show Folks Shoe Shop - Dedicated to Beauty in Foot Wear.”So enamored was Miller with his actresses, that on the side of the building he had four empty arched recesses built, where he left space for marble statues which would celebrate drama, comedy, opera and screen. A competition was held for nominations as to who should be enshrined on the shoe shop, asking “Who are America’s Best-Loved Actresses?” The four winners were Ethel Barrymore for drama, Marilyn Miller for comedy, Mary Pickford for film and Rosa Ponselle for opera, and their statuesque likenesses soon gazed upon Time Square from their golden niches.Miller’s Shoes closed its doors in the 1970s and a string of tenants saw the building fall into neglect. Its last residents, TGI Friday’s, being the principal culprits of the neglect. But the building’s fortunes were reversed last year when it was taken over by SL Green Realty and Wharton Properties. The facade was lovingly restored to its original beauty, and the new tenants are fittingly, a shoe seller.Broadway’s glittering stars may no longer shop there, but the restored building is, as its original sign still says “dedicated to beauty.” In an age where Times Square is a garish purgatory of advertising and noise, one can’t help but feel that Israel Miller and his passion for elegance would approve of his building’s longevity.Sign up for our newsletter and get the best of Atlas Obscura in your inbox.",

          "description": "Madison Square Park is a popular draw in New York City for both residents and tourists alike. But visitors enjoying their Shake Shack and view of the Flatiron Building have little idea that a human body is interred in a monument across Fifth Avenue from the west side of the Park at West 25th Street and Fifth Avenue. Inside the 51-foot obelisk lie the mortal remains of General William Jenkins Worth, one of only two monuments in New York that also serve as mausoleums. The other is the much more famous Grant’s Tomb uptown.General Worth fought in the War of 1812 and against the Seminoles in Florida, but made his name in the Mexican War of 1846-1848. He commanded at the Battle of Monterey, and is said to be the first American to make an amphibious landing, when he jumped from his boat during the attack on Veracruz. When Mexico City fell, it was Worth who climbed to the top of the National Palace and replaced the Mexican flag with the Stars and Stripes.When Worth died of cholera in San Antonio in 1848, he wasn’t quite the household name that Grant was, but when his remains were transported to New York for re-interment in 1856, the ceremony was marked by a procession to Madison Square Park accompanied by some 6,500 soldiers and a speech given by Mayor Fernando Wood.The mausoleum is located on a small traffic island bordered by 25th Street, Broadway, and 5th Avenue. The monument was designed by James Goodwin Batterson, whose pedigree also included being one of the builders of the Capitol and Library of Congress in Washington, D.C. It features plaques commemorating Worth’s principal battles, a bronze relief of the General himself astride his horse, and a relic box placed in the cornerstone.The monument hasn’t escaped the attention of some conspiracy theorists. Downtown from Madison Square Park is another obelisk, located in the churchyard of St Paul’s on lower Broadway. It was erected in memory of Thomas Addis Emmett, an Irish attorney and Freemason who immigrated to New York in 1804. Uptown in Central Park is the better-known Cleopatra’s Needle, a 3,500-year-old gift from Egypt, given to the U.S. in 1879. According to the theory of the obelisks, if you draw a straight line between the Emmett and Cleopatra’s Needle, it will pass directly through the Worth Monument (the General had been a Freemason, too).Whether the obelisks have anything to do with the Illuminati or Freemasons seems unlikely. But the Worth Monument remains one of New York’s largely un-noticed landmarks, one that thousands of people pass by every day without knowing there is an old soldier lying inside.The monument is located in the small pedestrian area just west of Madison Square Park, just below 25th StreetSign up for our newsletter and get the best of Atlas Obscura in your inbox.",

          "description": "On East 59th Street between 5th Avenue and Madison is a nondescript, grey and slightly dour looking building. Nine stories high and alleviated only with a relaxed and charming Italian wine bar occupying half of the ground floor, the building is as anonymous as it is unassuming. But once, Number 5, East 59th street was so exclusive in its glamorous secrecy that entry was only permitted to those holding a particular key. This key was plain except for a silver and black enameled rabbit head on one side, and an individual number on the reverse, next to the initials NY. Long since forgotten, this was once the home to Hugh Heffner’s famed Playboy Club.The first Playboy nightclub opened in Chicago in 1960, with New York following in December 1962. At one point, Heffner operated over 40 clubs all over the world, from Michigan to Manilla, where entrance could only gained by ownership of a key which cost $25 a year. The owner of the key would approach the doors of Number 5 and hand his key to a bunny girl guarding the entrance. Once inside, the aspiring playboys would find plush, dimly lit Playmate bars, dining rooms, cabarets, and club rooms all patrolled and serviced by the Playboy bunny waitresses.The Bunny Instruction Manual of 1968, given to all newly hired bunnies revealed, “Playboy Clubs are world famous for their distinctive decor....man-sized drinks and particularly their beautiful bunnies.” Amongst those serving the man-sized drinks in Manhattan were Debbie Harry, Lauren Hutton, and Gloria Steinem.Working life for a Playboy bunny was governed by strict rules that if broken would lead to instant dismissal. Dates with keyholders were absolutely forbidden, as was chewing gum on duty. Other offenses included “bunny ears not worn in centre of head, bent incorrectly” or worse of all “unkempt tail.” For some reason the rules were much stricter in New York. The manual specified that “at all clubs, except New York club, bunnies may dance with patrons....provided there is no close physical contact.” Whilst at Playboy clubs all over America, “the twist, watusi, bugaloo, etc. are examples of acceptable dances,” all were forbidden for the hard drinking ad men of Madison Avenue. Playboys may have expected the bunnies “to be a beautiful, well-groomed young lady who projects warmth and graciousness at all times” but the nightclubs eventually fell out of favor and began closing in quick succession throughout the 1980s, with the last closing in 1991. Several attempts to open modern version of the nightclubs in Las Vegas, London, and India have met with mixed success. The New York Playboy club closed its doors in 1986, bringing to an end the swinging era when most men wore cufflinks and tie clips, and were served man-sized Old Fashioned’s by Heffner’s glamorous bunny girls. Provided of course that their iconic rabbit ears were not bent incorrectly.Update March 2018: The restaurant is gone and the building is up for lease.Sign up for our newsletter and get the best of Atlas Obscura in your inbox.",

          "description": "The area around the Port Authority Bus Terminal in New York City is, depending on your point of view, either best avoided, or an endearing holdout of the gritty old midtown of peepshows and flop hotels. But in the midst of all the grime and noise of the bus terminal is a building of such beautiful art deco design that it was the only New York building shown at the influential International Style Expo of 1932. Completed in 1932, the same year as the Empire State Building, the skyscraper at 330 West 42nd Street was built specifically for publishing giants James McGraw and James Hill. McGraw chose for his architect Raymond Hood. A product of the Ecole des Beaux-Arts, Hood was responsible for some of America’s most outstanding buildings: the Tribune Tower in Chicago, the New York Daily News Building, and Rockefeller Center. As ostentatious as he was provocative, Hood is supposed to have been the inspiration for Peter Keating, Howard Roark’s foil in Ayn Rand’s The Fountainhead. And the McGraw-Hill Building immediately divided opinion. Manhattan’s most colorful skyscraper, Hood covered the exterior with green terra-cotta tiling that slowly turned blue higher up the building; his intent was to have it dissolve into the color of the sky. The green metal windows trimmed with vermillion turned the McGraw-Hill Building into an emerald gem, even down to the green and silver uniforms worn by the doormen. While not to everyone’s tastes (architectural critic Arthur North said it showed “disregard for every accepted principle of architectural designing in the most flagrant manner”), the 10th floor of the building became the home of Timely Publications, a pulp fiction company run by publisher Martin Goodman. On Columbus Day of 1941, Timely Publications posted a want-ad in the New York Times. The ad ran: “Comic Magazine Inkers Wanted: brush, no pen: must be familiar with technique of adventure comic magazines; suggest see Captain America Magazine for style before answering; salary or freelance basis. Bring sample to Room 1010, 330 West 42nd Street.”For Timely Publications was no ordinary pulp magazine company. Aspiring artists bringing their samples to room 1010 would have found hard at work some of the most influential creators of the golden age of American comic books. Timely’s first editor Joe Simon, along with artist Jack Kirby, created Captain America there. In Captain America Comics #1 (the cover of which has Cap cold-cocking Hitler), the building’s address was even given for fans who wanted to write to the good Captain. Building on the success of million-selling titles like the Human Torch (the robot one) and the Sub-Mariner, Timely would eventually become Marvel Comics. When Simon and Kirby left for National Comics (later DC), the 19-year-old general office assistant Stanley Lieber was made editor. He would later become much more famous under his assumed name: Stan Lee. Today the McGraw-Hill Building’s best days are behind it. Scaffolding covers the art deco font McGraw-Hill sign that decorated the entrance and top of the once-gleaming building. Timely Comics moved into the Empire State Building and Room 1010, once home to some of the most creative legends in the history of comic books,  is now the office of a pension advocate program for seniors. The McGraw-Hill Company vacated the building for 6th Avenue years ago, but Raymond Hood’s emerald green masterpiece is still there, a little worse for wear, but still, as Ayn Rand described in 1943, “the most beautiful building in New York City.” Sign up for our newsletter and get the best of Atlas Obscura in your inbox.",

          "description": "It’s nine o’clock on a Saturday.A mixed crowd has shuffled in. There’s an English graphic designer sitting next to you, making love to his tonic before he starts to sing.He belts out ‘Son Can you Play Me a Memory’ and hits every note just right. It sounds sad but it’s sweet - his act is complete when he throws out a classic Billy Joel pose.Can you see it? Then you’re ready to get on stage in The Baby Grand, New York’s smallest and one and only gallery annex karaoke bar. Whether it is named after the 1987 Billy Joel – Ray Charles duet from the album The Bridge, or the 5’1″ Steinway piano that was first introduced in the 1930s, the Baby Grand has set a name for itself over the last couple of years.Before going on stage and hugging the mike, you browse the songbooks at the bar, pay the bartender $1 for copyrights, take one more big sip of your liquid courage and start working the crowd - a crowd that is always supportive, and happy to make you feel like a real star, a King of Pop on 4 square meters of stage.The tiny place – that describes itself being a very intimate bar & tiny gallery, carefully crafted to optimize the communal singing experience and share the many talents of our patrons – can be found on the border of SoHo and Little Italy. But since the latter has started its retreat into history some decades ago, the O Sole Mio’s have been substituted by All American classics, Bowie songs and the legendary ‘Chocolate Balls’ karaoke performance of Bruce, the English neighbor of The Baby Grand.Go to 161 Lafayette at Grand in Manhattan, not BrooklynSign up for our newsletter and get the best of Atlas Obscura in your inbox.",

          "description": "Amid Manhattan’s jungle of brick and concrete stands a house that looks as though it would be more at home in a quiet suburb or a rolling countryside. Curious onlookers will likely want to know when this oddity was constructed, and they’re not alone; the house’s date of origin is a question that has puzzled preservationists for decades.The lot on which the house stands was originally part of a land purchase made by John Watts in 1747 that included 131 acres spanning present-day East 21st Street through East 30th Street. Documents from the 1780s indicate that Watts developed the property to include a main house as well as additional houses, outbuildings, orchards, and gardens. The estate was dubbed Rose Hill Farm, named after property Watts owned in Scotland.By 1811, Watts had been exiled from New York for his loyalty to England during the American Revolution, the main house at Rose Hill had burned to the ground, and the neighborhood had been parceled out into individual lots in preparation for the implementation of Manhattan’s grid system. In his New York Times piece on the Rose Hill House, Christopher Gray notes that the lot’s odd dimensions—50 feet by 24 feet—suggest a specific intention, perhaps to relocate an outbuilding from the original Rose Hill estate that would otherwise have been demolished to accommodate the grid.The first definitive documentation of a house on the 203 East 29th Street lot come from 1840 tax records. These records, however, indicate a three-story house, whereas most would consider the Rose Hill Historic House to be four stories.  Gray posits that the brick foundation of the current four-story house might have been added, and the house raised up an additional story, subsequent to 1840, but there’s no way to be sure. The foundation is certainly more in keeping with the surrounding neighborhood construction than the rest of the clapboard house, leading Scouting New York’s Nick Carr to note that the house appears to be floating.In all, attempts to establish the house’s age may have raised more questions than they answered. For instance, was the house relocated from the original estate, dating it back to the 1700s, or is it simply an 1800s-era home built on an oddly-shaped plot of land? And what of its height? Were the 1840s records of a three-story house a mistake or was the structure repositioned during the course of continuing construction?For a period of time in the 1900s the house functioned as a junk shop, but was boarded up by the time it was purchased in 1979 and subsequently gutted and converted to a three-bedroom apartment, leaving the original framing and roof intact. During that time, a preservation consultant estimated the house to date back to the 1790s, but the removal of the original interior has impeded any additional attempts to discern the house’s age.The upper stories of the house are currently rented out as an apartment. Despite its name and historical intrigue, the Rose Hill Historic House has not been officially designated as a historic landmark.Sign up for our newsletter and get the best of Atlas Obscura in your inbox.",

          "description": "When designer Massimo Vignelli’s redesigned New York City subway map appeared in 1972, people were less than enthusiastic. Where previous versions relied on a more recognizable approach to the map—water was blue, Central Park was more or less shaped like the actual location—Vignelli took a more unconventional approach. Water was beige and Central Park was square and scaled-down.Vignelli’s map, or as he preferred, “diagram,” wasn’t intended to be an accurate representation of New York City. “There is no reason why this geography has to be literal,” Vignelli explained. “It could be completely abstract.”He therefore decided to reinterpret the subway routes with some creative cartographic design. Stations became dots, threaded to their neighbors by color-coded lines with sharp angles. It was orderly, but not necessarily well-received by anyone but design lovers.City residents disliked the artistic misrepresentations of their city. Tourists found it difficult to match their destinations with the representations on the map. In an era before Google Maps, his artistic flair made navigating the city’s underbelly a touch more stressful.In 1979, the city replaced Vignelli’s map with a more traditional geographical model. This left Vignelli’s as a much-maligned, but also a much-revered treasure for graphic design enthusiasts.In later years, however, even the city embraced Vignelli’s creation, hiring the designer to create a map for the New York City Metropolitan Transportation Authority’s mobile app using his original design as inspiration.Most of the original Vignelli posters were torn down or covered over, but a recent discovery at a subway station on 57th Street has revealed the poster once again. The Manhattan station, a stop on the F-line, has one of Vignelli’s posters on display. Yet though there was some recent hype around this discovery, it’s more accurately a re-discovery, as the poster was spotted as long ago as 1999.This new excitement is probably a combination of new eyes seeing the poster in its native habitat for the first time and amazement at the fact it’s still there (although the poster’s home underneath plexiglass may explain the latter). But for as long as it remains, tourists and residents alike can catch a glimpse of this controversial map, complete with its beige water and square park.*As of Tuesday, January 23, 2018, this map is no longer visible.Sign up for our newsletter and get the best of Atlas Obscura in your inbox.",

          "description": "Before Donald Trump’s moniker was stamped all over New York City, there was another super-rich surname that dominated Manhattan real estate, and another bizarre story attached to it. Around the turn of the 20th century, the Wendels were one of the most powerful real estate families in New York, owning 150 properties in Manhattan, worth about $1 billion today. But they certainly didn’t act the part. The six Wendel siblings—five of whom were women—lived together in a mansion on 5th Avenue and barely ever set foot outside the house. The four-story, 40-room red brick brownstone became known as the “House of Mystery,” where “the Weird Wendels” lived like hermits.John G. Wendel, the one male, was eccentric at best, tyrannical at worst. He refused to allow his sisters to marry, worried that any children they had would dilute the family fortune. He gave them few opportunities to socialize with others, and lived like a recluse stuck in his ways. The house, built in 1856, was lit by gaslight up through the 1920s, eschewing modern amenities like electricity or telephone. Decades went by without any updates made to the musty furniture or decor, or the Wendels’ clothing—they wore outdated Victorian garb and traversed the city in an old carriage instead of a car on the rare occasion they went out.The last of the Wendel siblings, Ella, passed away in 1931. She left the Wendel home to Drew University requesting it remain as a memorial to the family in its current state (such that it was). The university maintains a memorial room on campus, but the prized site on 5th Avenue was razed in 1934 and gave way to commercial properties like the rest of the formerly residential avenue.Today there are a few reminders of the Wendel empire, outside a vault at Trinity Cemetery in lower Manhattan, and a bronze plaque the size of a door at the site of the former Wendel home on 5th Avenue.On 5th Ave right next to the Panera Bread.Sign up for our newsletter and get the best of Atlas Obscura in your inbox.",

          "name": "The Remnants of Tin Pan Alley",
          "description": "Tin Pan Alley is synonymous with the golden age of American song writing, when New York was the world’s epicenter of composing, lyric writing, and sheet music publishing. But less known is that Tin Pan Alley was an actual place, a small section of West 28th Street between Broadway and Sixth Avenue.Here in a line of small row houses, some of the most loved tunes in the American songbook were written, by names such as Irving Berlin, George Gershwin, Hoagy Carmichael, and Sammy Cahn. Today, Tin Pan Alley still exists, but the street of old brownstones are in a sadly dilapidated state, unprotected by the city or by any landmark status, and at constant risk of being demolished. This small street is today largely filled with wholesalers and cell phone accessory stores, whilst the historic buildings themselves are steadily falling apart through neglect.The heyday of Tin Pan Alley ran approximately from the 1880s to about the time of the Great Depression. Following the Civil War, sales of parlour pianos boomed throughout the country, with some estimates putting sales at around 25,000 new pianos a year. In an era before radios and records, parlour pianos made by companies such as Baldwin, Wissner, and Sterling provided the most popular forms of home entertainment. And all these pianos led to a soon prospering business in composing and sheet music publishing.The origins of “Tin Pan Alley” itself are unrecorded, although the most commonly told story is of a reporter from the now defunct New York Herald, called Monroe Rosenfeld, who, whilst walking down this small block on 28th Street, heard the dissonant sound of dozens of pianos in the publishing houses lining the street, competing with each other through the open windows. “It sounds like a bunch of tin pans clanging,” he is reported to have said. The Tin Pan Alley of turn of the century New York was a vibrant, frenetic block; starting with the owners of the publishing companies themselves, such as Irving Berlin, Isadore Witmark, Thomas Harms, and the Remick Music Company. Each house kept a staff of composers and song writers, who would write in such varied styles as vaudeville, operettas, rags, comic songs, and ballads. Often the songs were sold as separate sheets with luxuriously designed covers. Houses would also hire “song pluggers,” musicians and singers who would then perform the new songs in the music shops to expose them to both the public and the entertainers who would visit Tin Pan Alley in search of new songs for their acts.Today, the theatre district is most commonly connected with Times Square, but during this era, the theatres lined Broadway a little further down, centred around Herald Square, just on Tin Pan Alley’s doorstep. Countless theaters, vaudeville houses, and musical saloons thronged the neighborhood, with all of them searching for new songs. Roy McCardell, a reporter for the New York World, wrote about visiting Tin Pan Alley in 1903, “Every day you’ll see noted people in the musical comedy world hunting in the “Alley” for songs that will add to their fame - Paula Edwardes, Marie Cahill, Blanche Ring, Dan Daly, Marie Dressler, and Lew Dockstader active in the hunt.” Names that have all but faded from history. Walking down Tin Pan Alley today is a different experience. Many of the old brownstones which have survived demolition are in advanced stages of neglect, and are slowly falling apart, despite their importance to American culture. Across the street from No. 45, (which published music by George Gershwin, as well as the Wizard of Oz), is a slender, ornately decorated building, No. 40, looking today much as it did in 1908 when Jack Norworth and Albert Von Tilzer wrote “Take Me Out To The Ballgame.” One of the great songwriters of Tin Pan Alley, George M. Cohan, wrote over 300 songs at Tin Pan Alley, most notably the World War I hit “Over There,” and “Give My Regards To Broadway.” Other notable songs written here include “Alexander’s Ragtime Band,” “Sweet Georgia Brown” and “God Bless America.” The advent of phonographs and the radio saw the popularity of home piano playing rapidly dwindle, and by the 1920s, the once great publishing houses of Tin Pan Alley were virtually all gone. Today the history of this small street, that gave birth to the modern music industry, and where some of America’s most beloved songs were written, remains largely forgotten. Unprotected by the city or any landmark status, it is real danger of disappearing for good, like the countless songwriters, vaudeville actors, and Broadway singers who once thrived on this street.Sign up for our newsletter and get the best of Atlas Obscura in your inbox.",

          "description": "As the 19th century became the 20th century, the plight of tuberculosis patients started influencing housing in all sorts of ways. In New York City, it took the shape of a sanitary tenement.The idea, from Dr. Henry Shively of Presbyterian Hospital, was to create comfortable, healthy housing for poorer families with members who suffered from tuberculosis. Anne Harriman Vanderbilt (wife of William K. Vanderbilt Sr.) provided the funds, and Henry Atterbury Smith designed the four interconnected six-story buildings. Construction began in 1909 and the East River Homes opened in 1912.Now called Cherokee Apartments, the complex occupies the space from 77th Street to 78th Street between John Jay Park and PS 158. Most of the windows are floor to ceiling and have three sashes, allowing for a lot of light and air to come in, both having been deemed crucial for TB sufferers. This also allows them to open wide out onto iron balconies, on which sleeping was encouraged. The pent eave roof was designed to hang over the balconies, protecting patients from the elements.The floors are concrete and curve up onto the wall, eliminating corners that could trap germs and dust, and ensuring that any carpeting would be removable. The stairways in the corners of the buildings are open to the air, have two banisters (one for adults, one for kids), and were built with chairs on each landing, so that tuberculosis patients climbing to the sixth floor had convenient and comfortable places to rest if they started to have trouble breathing. Every apartment opened directly out to the stairs, giving a sense of the independence of a private house.The rooftops and courtyards were designed to be pleasing, safe, and healthy places to aid in recovery. The stairwells were topped by story-high glazed skylights that allowed air to circulate up and down the stairs.The originally family sized apartments have been rearranged in recent years to have fewer, larger rooms, and the facilities that made the roofs such nice places to spend time and recover have been removed, as have the skylights. The buildings never accomplished what Shively had hoped, because while 48 of the rooms were, at first, leased as a Home Hospital, most of the tenants turned out to be on the wealthier side. Poor families, for the most part, could not afford to live in the apartments.Today, Cherokee Apartments is a housing cooperative and the building is a historic landmark. As such, the outside must be preserved, and many of the unique features from its origins as a tuberculosis sanitarium can still be seen.Sign up for our newsletter and get the best of Atlas Obscura in your inbox.",

          "name": "The Marine Grill Murals of the McAlpin Hotel",
          "description": "The Fulton Street Station on New York’s subway system recently benefitted from a 10-year, $1.4 billion overhaul. The centre piece of the MTA’s “Grand Central of Downtown,” which re-opened in November of 2014, was an elaborate “oculus” dome of glass and aluminium, spanning 53-feet in diameter, representing what the MTA grandly called “a metaphor for the celestial heaven.” As impressive as the giant skylight is, there was quite a remarkable spectacle already in place at Fulton Street Station, hidden away and largely unnoticed at the William Street entrance; the beautiful tile murals that once adorned the walls of the Marine Grill, a grand restaurant located in what was once the world’s largest hotel, the McAlpin.The Hotel McAlpin was situated in Herald Square, occupying the corner block of 34th Street and Broadway. Opening in 1912 and soaring 25-stories high, the McAlpin had room enough for 2,500 guests. As well as being, at the time, the world’s largest hotel, it was also one of the most luxurious. The amenities on offer to guests were as breathtaking as they were opulent, including a massive giant Turkish bath and plunge pool that occupied the entire 24th floor. The hotel also had its own in-house orchestra, as well as its own fully equipped hospital. Located on the floor below the Turkish bath, patients benefitted from “every modern appliance known to surgery.” The hotel even had gender specific floors, with newspaper adverts promising that “for unaccompanied women, the entire sixth floor is reserved.” There was even a separate check-in desk staffed by women, so that single female travelers could avoid the approaches of scoundrels in the main lobby. Such was the attention given to customer service that the entire 16th floor was reserved for night workers so they could sleep during the day; the New York Times christened the floor the “Sleepy Sixteenth.”These heights of luxury extended to the Marine Grill restaurant located in the basement. Dominated by a forest of archways and columns, the grill room was covered in exquisite tile murals designed by Frederick Dana Marsh. The tiles told the story of the maritime history of New York, and featured elaborate murals of steamships, paddle steamers, and ocean liners from the golden age of Trans-Atlantic voyages.The 20 murals, fabricated by the Atlantic Terra Cotta Company of Staten Island, spoke to the era when New York was one of the world’s most vibrant, and busiest ports. Covering the entire wall space, they would have looked down on a packed room of patrons dining on lobster and oysters, washed down with Gibson cocktails. In the 1970s, the grand McAlpin was sold and converted into 700 apartments, which still exist today, under the name Herald Towers. During renovations, the glorious tile murals were simply thrown away. Susan Tunick, president of the non-profit Friends of Terra Cotta, alerted the New York Landmarks Preservation Committee and the tiles were rescued from the dumpsters outside the old hotel. The tiles were then given to the MTA’s Arts for Transit Program, and they were reassembled piece by piece like a giant jigsaw puzzle over one summer by a group of college interns. In 2000 the restored murals were installed in the Fulton Street Station, along with the ornate iron gate that had adorned the entrance to the Marine Grill. New York may have lost one of its grand old hotels, but subway passengers entering Fulton Street Station by the Williams Street entrance can see a little known remnant of its once luxurious opulence.Sign up for our newsletter and get the best of Atlas Obscura in your inbox.",

          "name": "Nero Wolfe's Brownstone",
          "description": "Despite never being directly identified in the novels the home of Rex Stout’s beloved fictional detective, Nero Wolfe has been officially recognized by the City of New York. Sherlock Holmes’ residence at 221B Baker Street is well known the world over, but one of his American counterparts, Nero Wolfe’s home has long been a mystery. Over the course of 33 novels and 39 short stories written between 1934 and 1975, mystery writer Rex Stout gave numerous addresses on West 35th Street in New York, most of which, never existed.  For instance, in the novel, The Silent Speaker, Nero Wolfe’s business card gives his address as 922 West 35th Street, a city block which would lie someway in the middle of the Hudson River. The books describe the luxurious brownstone as having three floors, a private elevator and a rooftop greenhouse. From his HQ, the corpulent detective would drink three cases of beer a day, tend his 10,000 orchids, and solve murders, all written down by his faithful ally and house mate, Archie Goodwin. In The Forth of July Picnic (1957) Nero Wolfe says “I suggest beginning with autobiographical sketches from each of us, and here is mine. I was born in Montenegro and spent my early boyhood there. At the age of sixteen I decided to move around, and in fourteen years I became acquainted with most of Europe, a little of Africa, and much of Asia, in a variety of roles and activities. Coming to this country in nineteen-thirty, not penniless, I bought this house and entered into practice as a private detective.” However the book Champagne For One provided the most important key to the puzzle. Stout notes that the brownstone had a back entrance leading to a private garden from which a passage leads to 34th Street to be used to enter or leave Wolfe’s home when it was necessary to evade surveillance.Today, little remains of Rex Stout’s West 35th Street, and certainly no brownstones. Much of West 35th Street’s topography was change during the building of the Lincoln Tunnel in the 1950’s, yet this did not stop the author’s intrepid fans. Investigating the street in 1996, the Rex Stout fan club, known as “The Wolfe Pack,” identified that the only house which fitted this description was 454 West 35th Street and that the address must be the home of Nero Wolfe and Archie Goodwin. So confident in their find, the group, with the help of the City Park’s department, had a plaque placed to commemorate New York’s greatest private detective. The plaque reads, “On this site stood the elegant brownstone of the corpulent fictional private detective Nero Wolfe. With his able assistant Archie Goodwin, Mr. Wolfe raised orchids and dined well, while solving over seventy cases as recorded by Rex Stout from 1934-1975.” Today the building is home to a non-profit organization, renovated and managed by Clinton Housing Development Company.  Sign up for our newsletter and get the best of Atlas Obscura in your inbox.",

All the same, sometimes it’s nice to move past the old standbys. Perhaps you’d rather have frog casserole? Or sea cucumber and goose web in abalone sauce? Or just a small plate of duck blood with chives and ginger? With such bizarre options, Congee Village is perfect for eaters looking for a little more adventure. The Cantonese-style restaurant named after a savory rice porridge that people in Asian countries have been indulging in since ancient times. Accessible from J,M,Z Trains at Essex Street Station and F Train at Delancey Street StationSign up for our newsletter and get the best of Atlas Obscura in your inbox.",

Modeled after the set for the London play called Pomander Walk, this neighborhood anomaly sits incongruously amongst the surrounding high rise buildings of the Upper West Side. But that’s all part of its pastel-colored charm.Just ask Humphrey Bogart or Woody Allen, both of whom owned property in the neighborhood. Sadly, most of us will have to take their word for it since the community is private and kept gated at all times.

          "description": "One of the most delightful experiences in the bustling metropolis of Manhattan is in finding a secluded oasis within it. In a city where space is at a premium, there remains hidden away a lush garden of solitude, known to only a very few. Remarkably, this pleasant, quiet meadow can be found in the jostling streets of the busy Financial District in Lower Manhattan. Or more specifically, above it!The Elevated Acre is precisely that: a one-acre meadow flanked by delightfully designed gardens and plantings elevated above the city streets. Its entrance is fairly anonymous, an escalator at 55 Water Street, set back from the sidewalk. Currently surrounded by construction, passersby will often overlook it. But if you venture up the escalators you will find the marvelous Elevated Acre.The secretive urban oasis features a lawn, an amphitheater, a summer beer garden, winding paths of Brazilian hardwood, spectacular views of the East River, Brooklyn, and the Brooklyn Bridge, and above all, pleasant solitude. This elevated one-acre park is one of Manhattan’s most relaxing secrets.Sign up for our newsletter and get the best of Atlas Obscura in your inbox.",

It mushroomed in 2007, surfing the wave of a “bling vanitas” trend launched by Damien Hirst.Goldbar, as its name suggests, is covered from floor to ceiling with the eponymous precious metal. The most famous part of the small, glowing salon is the display of gilt, jawless craniums adorning the wall, emulating ancient Capuchin crypts.From portraits d’apparat to tables custom-made to look like Cartier bracelets, everything is designed to be a constant reminder of the glamorous elitism that patrons get to be a part of – that is, if the bouncer let them in.Spring St (4, 6, 6X)\nBowery (J)\nCanal St (4, 6, 6X)Sign up for our newsletter and get the best of Atlas Obscura in your inbox.",

          "description": "Comprised of seven wall hangings, each at least 12 feet high by 8 feet wide, the Unicorn Tapestries at the Cloisters were created 500 years ago by an unknown artist for unknown royalty in Western Europe.In violent and disturbing detail, the series tells the story of hunters stalking through the woods with their canines, hunting the mythical beast. As the story progresses, the unicorn is found and surrounded, ambushed and eventually attacked from all sides. Despite getting away from the hunters, the unicorn is eventually calmed by a virgin maiden and killed while under her charm.Most people who have studied the tapestries believe they come from 1495-1505, from somewhere in southern Holland. Although even those details are often debated. Despite a general geographic location, the identity of the author is completely unknown. The tapestries’ only connection to the past is a small cipher, showing the letters A and B intertwined by some rope, which may signify the artist or the owner of the work.From this slight hint, some have devised that Anne of Brittany commissioned the works to celebrate her marriage to Louis XII, but there is no conclusive proof and the code of the Unicorn Tapestries remains unbroken. Despite the mystery, art historians have reveled in the chance to interpret the tapestries, often comparing the hunt of the unicorn to the Passion of Christ. The unicorn itself, once a pagan symbol, became a symbol for Christ.All of the vibrant tapestries are available for personal interpretation and are held in the Cloisters Museum in Upper Manhattan. The exhibit is accompanied by the 6-foot long horn of a narwhal, which many in 16th century Europe confused with the horn of a unicorn, inspiring stories and depictions of the magical beast.Currently displayed in gallery 17Sign up for our newsletter and get the best of Atlas Obscura in your inbox.",

          "description": "Secreted away on the second floor of the MANEAST11 garbage truck garage is an ever-growing collection of strange items that have been plucked from the trash, and while it is not open to the public it is populated by their stuff.The collection was started by a single sanitation engineer by the name of Nelson Molina who started plucking treasures from his route over 20 years ago with the simple intention of giving his corner of the garage a little flare. However his hoarding quickly caught on as some of his fellow coworkers began adding weird little pieces to his collection. Everything from exotic lamps to fake flowers to pieces of pop kitsch are carefully extracted from the deluge of upper Manhattan waste, but everything that is admitted into the collection is approved by Molina. The collection is not organized in any formal way but Molina tends to group the pieces by size, general theme, and color.“Stealing” things from the trash for personal use is a big no-no in the world of sanitation, but since the whimsical collection is for the private viewing of the workers, Molina’s lovely hoard has been allowed to remain. Anyone wanting to take a look at this treasure trove of lovely cast-offs can get in touch with the city to request access, but sanitation workers are allowed any time.Email tours@dsny.nyc.gov to see when tours are happening.Sign up for our newsletter and get the best of Atlas Obscura in your inbox.",

          "description": "Tucked away in the heart of Midtown—only a few blocks from its sister park, Greenacre—lies the beautifully minuscule refuge that is Paley Park. Dubbed a “vest-pocket” park, it’s just 4,200 sq ft., and serves as a retreat from the daily grind of the urban world that exists just outside of its borders.Paley Park’s most significant feature is the 20-foot waterfall that reaches across the entire back of the small space, creating a soothing buffer of sound that helps to drown out the bustle of the surrounding city. The white noise combined with the encompassing ivy-covered walls and the shelter of honey locusts provides a convincing illusion of privacy and seclusion, fostering an atmosphere of tranquility in the city that never sleeps.Commissioned and financed by the William S. Paley Foundation, and finished in 1967, Paley Park is a privately owned public space. William Paley, a former chairman of CBS, was very involved in the conception and design process of the place. He named Paley Park in honor of his father, and commemorated his efforts with a plaque that reads, “This park is set aside in memory of Samuel Paley, 1875–1963, for the enjoyment of the public,” near the entrance.In William H. Whyte’s 1980 text and subsequent film, The Social Life of Small Urban Spaces, Paley Park’s social environment and relationships were analyzed. Whyte wished to understand what made places like Paley Park successful, and what drew people to spontaneously enter. He concluded that despite creating an atmosphere of solitude, Paley Park is still very much an urban space: Midtown is still very visible from the entrance, and the sidewalk just below Paley’s stoop is heavily traveled. This dichotomy works in the park’s favor. People are drawn into the park off the busy sidewalk, coaxed away from their routines, if only for a few moments, to go sit in Paley with the din of the waterfall all around them.Sign up for our newsletter and get the best of Atlas Obscura in your inbox.",

          "description": "The New York Society Library occupies a 5-story Italianate mansion in the Upper East Side, replete with wood panelled readings rooms and winding staircases. New Yorkers have devoured books at the Society Library since 1754, the oldest cultural institution in the city. An act of civic duty motivated the group of six locals who founded the New York Society Library, the first public library in the city. It opened in humble surroundings: a single room in the old City Hall. During the Revolution, British soldiers looted books and brought the library to its knees. Men robbed the place of many of its possessions; books torn up and stuffed down rifle barrels and some even sold for bottles of rum. Some time passed before the Society Library reopened.The library returned to its original home in City Hall and at a time when New York was the nation’s capital, became the first Library of Congress. By 1795 the 5,000 strong collection moved to 33 Nassau Street. Society Library continued to move uptown before it settled in 1937 in 53 East 79th Street. Its present home is a registered New York City Landmark. The original charter granted by King George III still hangs inside the luxurious property. Society Library boasts a collection of nearly 300,000 volumes.  Sign up for our newsletter and get the best of Atlas Obscura in your inbox.",

Takayama prepares each perfect bite-size gift, then places it in front of you on a spare slate; you almost eat out of his hands, and the sushi seems to melt in your mouth. This process is, to some serious food lovers, a priceless experience.",
